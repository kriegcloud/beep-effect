## Purpose

### Problem

No TypeScript + Effect v4 knowledge graph exists for intellectual property law that is grounded in published OWL ontologies. IP attorneys and legal technologists lack a typed, composable graph layer for reasoning about patents, trademarks, copyrights, licensing, and jurisdictional scope. Existing solutions are either SPARQL-only academic prototypes or untyped JavaScript libraries with no formal ontological basis.

### Solution

A 5-phase spec that produces:

1. A curated survey of 7 published OWL ontologies covering IP law, legal reasoning, and normative concepts.
2. Effect Schema definitions (tagged unions + typed edge records) grounded in those ontologies.
3. A FalkorDB-backed graph storage layer with Cypher queries.
4. A seed data pipeline demonstrating patent, trademark, and copyright scenarios.
5. Full verification against repository quality gates.

### Why It Matters

- **Formal grounding** — OWL ontologies provide a peer-reviewed conceptual backbone; the graph is not ad-hoc.
- **Effect-first composability** — Schema-driven nodes and edges integrate with the repo's Effect pipelines for error decomposition, dependency injection, and type safety.
- **Attorney-facing potential** — Downstream UIs and search tools can rely on a well-typed, well-documented graph API rather than raw SQL or unstructured documents.

## Source-of-Truth Contract

The following 7 OWL ontologies serve as the formal conceptual grounding for this knowledge graph. All class hierarchies, object properties, and reasoning constraints referenced in this spec trace to these sources.

| # | Ontology | Domain | Access URL |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | LKIF-Core | Upper legal ontology (norms, roles, actions, expressions) | https://github.com/RinkeHoekstra/lkif-core |
| S2 | IPRonto / ALIS | Intellectual property rights (patents, trademarks, designs) | https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/IST-2001-33174 |
| S3 | Copyright Ontology | Copyright law (works, rights, authorship, licensing) | https://rhizomik.net/ontologies/copyrightonto/ |
| S4 | JudO | Judicial decisions and case law structure | https://github.com/legalontology/JudO |
| S5 | LCBR | Legal case-based reasoning patterns | https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3689543 |
| S6 | ESTRELLA | European legal knowledge management framework | https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/IST-2004-027655 |
| S7 | WIPO IPC | International Patent Classification hierarchy | https://www.wipo.int/classifications/ipc/en/ |

**Contract:** Every node type and edge type in the schema design (P1) must cite at least one source from S1-S7. Types that cannot be traced to a published ontology require an explicit ADR justifying their inclusion.

## Architecture Decision Records

| ADR | Decision Surface | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| ADR-001 | Ontology selection strategy | LKIF-Core as upper ontology; domain modules (IPRonto, Copyright Ontology, JudO) layered on top | LKIF-Core [S1] provides the broadest legal upper ontology with stable class hierarchies for norms, roles, and expressions. Domain ontologies [S2][S3][S4] specialize IP-specific concepts without duplicating upper-level abstractions. |
| ADR-002 | Graph database | FalkorDB | Aligns with repo-codegraph-canonical precedent in this repository. GraphBLAS engine provides sub-millisecond traversal. Zero external infrastructure for dev. falkordblite available for testing. |
| ADR-003 | OWL parsing approach | rdfxml-streaming-parser + n3.js in TypeScript | No Python dependency. Both packages are maintained, ESM-compatible, and handle RDF/XML and Turtle serializations that the target ontologies use. Streaming parser keeps memory bounded for large ontology files. |
| ADR-004 | Effect Schema mapping | OWL classes map to tagged unions with `_tag`; object properties map to typed edge records | Preserves OWL class hierarchy semantics via discriminated unions. Edge records carry source/target node IDs + relationship metadata. Integrates with existing repo `S.TaggedClass` patterns. |
| ADR-005 | Query language | Cypher via FalkorDB (no SPARQL runtime) | FalkorDB natively supports Cypher. Avoids introducing a SPARQL runtime dependency. Cypher is sufficient for sub-graph extraction, path queries, and property filtering required by this spec. |

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| OWL ontology files unavailable or broken URLs | P0 blocked; cannot verify class hierarchies | Medium | Cache ontology files locally during P0; document fallback sources; IPRonto/ALIS may require CORDIS archive retrieval |
| OWL reasoning constraints lost in translation to Effect Schema | Schema does not capture cardinality, disjointness, or transitivity from OWL | High | Document every dropped constraint in P1 output with explicit justification; add runtime validation where feasible |
| LKIF-Core class hierarchy too deep for practical tagged unions | Schema becomes unwieldy with 50+ types | Medium | Flatten to 15 domain-relevant types; map deep OWL hierarchies to metadata fields rather than union branches |
| FalkorDB Cypher dialect missing features needed for legal queries | Cannot express required graph patterns | Low | FalkorDB supports OpenCypher subset which covers path queries, OPTIONAL MATCH, and aggregation; verify during P2 |
| rdfxml-streaming-parser cannot parse all target ontology files | P0 research incomplete for affected ontologies | Medium | Fall back to n3.js Turtle parser; some ontologies publish both RDF/XML and Turtle; manual extraction as last resort |
| Seed data insufficient to exercise all node and edge types | Verification gaps; untested schema branches | Medium | Define minimum seed coverage matrix in P2; require at least 1 instance per node type and 1 instance per edge type |

## Execution Plan

### P0: Ontology Research

1. Retrieve or access all 7 OWL ontology files from the URLs in the Source-of-Truth Contract.
2. For each ontology, document: OWL dialect, serialization format, top-level class hierarchy, object properties relevant to IP law, and any reasoning constraints (cardinality, disjointness, transitivity).
3. Produce a class-to-node-type mapping table showing which OWL classes inform each of the 15 planned node types.
4. Identify gaps where planned types have weak ontological grounding and flag for ADR review.

**Test Cases:**
- Each of the 7 ontology sections in the output contains non-empty class lists
- Class-to-node-type mapping covers all 15 planned types
- At least 3 reasoning constraints documented per ontology that has them

**Verification Gate:** `outputs/p0-ontology-research.md` exists, is substantive, and all 7 ontology sections are populated.

### P1: Schema Design

1. Read P0 output and the Source-of-Truth Contract.
2. Define 15 node types as `S.TaggedClass` definitions with `_tag` discriminant, required fields, and optional metadata fields.
3. Define 11+ edge types as typed records with `sourceId`, `targetId`, `_type` discriminant, and relationship metadata.
4. Compose node types into a `NodeKind` tagged union and edge types into an `EdgeKind` tagged union.
5. Document every OWL reasoning constraint that was dropped during translation and justify the decision.

**Test Cases:**
- Every `S.TaggedClass` compiles without type errors
- `NodeKind` union has exactly 15 branches
- `EdgeKind` union has at least 11 branches
- Each type has a `/** @source S# */` JSDoc annotation

**Verification Gate:** `outputs/p1-schema-design.md` exists with complete schema definitions; no open design decisions remain.

### P2: Implementation Plan

1. Read P1 output.
2. Define package scaffold order (which files to create first, dependency relationships).
3. Produce a file-level plan listing every source file with its purpose, exports, and dependencies.
4. Define seed data plan: which entities to create, which relationships to establish, expected graph shape.
5. List quality gates that must pass before P3 is considered done.

**Test Cases:**
- File-level plan covers all schema types from P1
- Seed data plan references at least 1 patent, 1 trademark, 1 copyright scenario
- Quality gates include `pnpm check`, `pnpm lint-fix`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`

**Verification Gate:** `outputs/p2-implementation-plan.md` exists with file-level plan and seed data strategy.

### P3: Implementation

1. Read P2 output.
2. Create package scaffold in dependency order.
3. Implement Effect Schema definitions for all node and edge types.
4. Implement FalkorDB storage layer with create, read, and query operations.
5. Implement seed data pipeline and load representative data.
6. Write unit tests for schema validation and integration tests for graph queries.
7. Document any deviations from the P2 plan.

**Test Cases:**
- All planned source files exist
- `pnpm check` passes for the new package
- `pnpm test` passes all tests
- Seed data loads without errors

**Verification Gate:** `outputs/p3-implementation-notes.md` documents all implemented files, test results, and deviations.

### P4: Verification

1. Run `pnpm check` and record output.
2. Run `pnpm lint-fix` and record output.
3. Run `pnpm test` and record output.
4. Run `pnpm build` and record output.
5. Classify any failures and document resolutions.
6. Write final readiness statement.

**Test Cases:**
- All 4 commands produce exit code 0
- No pre-existing failures attributed to this package
- Readiness statement present

**Verification Gate:** `outputs/p4-verification.md` contains all command outputs and a signed-off readiness statement.

---

## Assumptions and Defaults

- **Package location:** `packages/ip-law-graph` within the monorepo
- **Effect version:** v4 (current repo standard)
- **FalkorDB client:** `falkordb` npm package (TypeScript bindings)
- **Testing framework:** `vitest` (repo standard) or `bun test`
- **Schema pattern:** `S.TaggedClass` with `_tag` discriminant (repo convention)
- **Edge record pattern:** Plain `S.Struct` with `_type` discriminant, `sourceId`, `targetId` fields
- **Seed data format:** TypeScript constants or JSON fixtures loaded via Effect pipeline
- **No runtime OWL reasoning:** OWL is used as a design-time reference only; no OWL reasoner in the runtime dependency graph

---

## Exit Condition

This spec is complete when another agent can execute P0 through P4 without making any additional design decisions and can deliver a `packages/ip-law-graph` package that passes all repository quality gates with a typed knowledge graph grounded in the 7 specified OWL ontologies.
