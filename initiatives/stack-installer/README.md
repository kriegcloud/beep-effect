# Stack Installer

## Status

Active

## Overview

This initiative defines the AI Stack installer and manager for non-technical
lawyers and financial advisors who want Claude or Codex working safely on a
fresh machine without learning terminal workflows. The product is both a
first-run setup flow and an ongoing manager for repair, channel-add, credential
rotation, and validation.

V1 is intentionally narrow: macOS and Windows parity, Linux best-effort, one
Discord channel, subscription-first provider auth, 1Password as the secret bus,
and an approval-first UI. The terminal remains plumbing; the daily-driver
surface is Claude Desktop or Codex Desktop plus one OpenClaw channel as a
secondary path.

P0 created the initiative packet only. P1A added the runnable dry-run spine:
package contracts, deterministic manifest snapshot, `@beep/ui` web shell, and
a minimal Tauri 2 bridge. The P1 live Manual Mode harness is now implemented:
driver packages validate 1Password, provider auth, host commands, and Discord
liveness, and the app exposes Tauri and CLI proof capture commands. Fresh-OS
macOS proof is complete and audited. Windows proof is temporarily waived only
to let the P1C review/fix loop start. Full P1 still stays open until a real
Windows proof artifact is returned and audited. P1D is now complete on Linux:
the app-first Bun repair milestone proved one real approval-first host repair
action, while the Windows proof remains explicit open P1 debt and a hard gate
before P2.

## Current Progress

- P0 is complete: the packet exists, locked decisions are recorded, the
  corrected installer slice topology is named, and the manifest points to P1.
- P1A is complete: the dry-run package spine and Stack Installer web shell
  exist, validate 1Password-reference-only inputs, compose slice-owned verb
  contracts, and render a deterministic manifest preview.
- P1 live harness is implemented: app-local proof composition, Tauri command,
  CLI artifact capture/audit, and live driver-backed validators exist. macOS
  proof is complete. Windows proof is missing but temporarily waived only for
  sequencing; full P1 remains open until Windows proof is real and audited.
- P1C is complete: the PR readiness review/fix loop is recorded with the
  temporary Windows missing-proof waiver and zero remaining required blockers.
- P1D is complete: the Tauri app became the primary operator surface for a
  Linux-first Bun repair run, completed one real approval-first dependency
  repair action, and now reports the healthy/no-op state clearly after repair.
- P2 is pending after the real Windows proof: AI Mode parity across Claude and
  Codex with byte-identical manifest output modulo timestamps.
- P3 is pending: recovery proof from salted-broken-state machines.
- P4 is pending: portability proof from exported manifest on Machine A to
  imported validator suite on Machine B.
- P5 is pending: distribution readiness with signed binaries, updates,
  opt-in telemetry, crash reporting, feedback, and target CI.

## Completion Standard

This initiative is done only when all are true:

- [x] P1 Discord Manual Mode fresh-OS macOS proof is recorded.
- [ ] P1 Discord Manual Mode fresh-OS Windows proof is recorded.
- [x] P1 PR readiness review/fix loop is recorded with zero required blockers
  or explicit waivers.
- [x] P1D app-first Manual Installer UX is recorded with a real app-driven
  dependency repair action.
- [ ] P2 AI Mode parity is recorded for Claude and Codex with a
  byte-identical-manifest gate modulo timestamps.
- [ ] P3 recovery scenarios prove repair for wrong Node version, invalid
  Discord token, and missing 1Password reference.
- [ ] P4 portability proves macOS export to Windows-WSL import with validators
  green without re-running setup.
- [ ] P5 distribution readiness proves signed macOS and Windows binaries,
  auto-update, opt-in telemetry, crash reporting, feedback, and CI builds.
