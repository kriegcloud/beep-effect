(# Admin Client Implementation Working Notes

These notes capture the state of the ongoing `@beep/iam-sdk` admin client work so a fresh GPT-5 Codex session can resume without re-discovering context. Follow the order below to rebuild understanding and recover momentum.

## 1. Source Material Consulted

| Topic | Reference | Tool Call |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Package orientation | `packages/iam/sdk/AGENTS.md` | `jetbrains__get_file_text_by_path` |
| Better Auth admin process | `BETTER_AUTH_CLIENT_METHOD_PROCESS.md` | `jetbrains__get_file_text_by_path` |
| Admin checklist (scope of methods) | `BETTER_AUTH_CLIENT_AND_METHODS_LIST.md` (admin section) | `jetbrains__get_file_text_by_path` |
| Better Auth official docs | `context7__get-library-docs {"topic":"plugins/admin"}` | `context7__get-library-docs` |
| Better Auth OpenAPI excerpt | `better-auth-api-spec.json` search for `/admin` endpoints | `jetbrains__execute_terminal_command` (Python snippets) |
| Client plugin type definitions | `node_modules/better-auth/dist/client/plugins/index.d.ts` + `.mjs` | `jetbrains__execute_terminal_command` (print excerpts) |
| Server plugin types (UserWithRole, payloads) | `node_modules/better-auth/dist/plugins/admin/index.d.ts` | `jetbrains__execute_terminal_command` |

Keep these files open; they contain the canonical shapes for request/response payloads used while modelling the contracts.

## 2. Current Edit State

### 2.1 Contracts (`packages/iam/sdk/src/clients/admin/admin.contracts.ts`)
- Added comprehensive schemas for every admin endpoint.
- Introduced shared structures (`AdminUser`, `AdminSession`, etc.).
- **Important issue:** some fields currently import from `@beep/shared-domain/entity-ids` and primitive schemas. Review the TypeScript build failures (see §3) to reconcile shape mismatches.

### 2.2 Implementations (`packages/iam/sdk/src/clients/admin/admin.implementations.ts`)
- All admin methods wired through `makeFailureContinuation`, full decode/notify logic.
- **Blocking:** several casts using `as any` were introduced temporarily during build troubleshooting; per latest instruction they must be removed (see §4).
- Session-mutation handlers notify `$sessionSignal`.

No other files touched beyond the new working notes.

## 3. Build Status

Command: `PATH="$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH" bun run build --filter=@beep/iam-sdk`

Outcome: **failing**. Key diagnostics to address in next session:

1. **Schema Usage Errors**
   - `AdminUser` currently references `SharedEntityIds.UserId` etc.; TypeScript complains certain optional schema helpers are not compatible with `Contract.make` expectations (e.g., `optionalWith` not matching `Schema.All`). Need to rework these property schemas (likely switch to plain `S.String`/`S.optional` wrappers).
   - Similar issue for `AdminSession` fields.

2. **Permission Payload Struct**
   - `AdminHasPermissionPayload` currently declared as a `Class` but registered incorrectly with `Contract.make` (`parameters` expects `.fields`). Reconcile by switching back to `S.Struct`/custom validation pipeline that enforces "exactly one of" semantics without using `ParseResult` heavy logic.

3. **Client Type Mismatches**
   - Better Auth client type definitions expect specific literal unions for roles (`"user" | "admin" | ...`). We must align the contract payload types and encoded values (likely reusing enums from docs or narrowing to string literals) so we no longer need casts.
   - `client.admin.createUser` expects redacted email/password types; adjust call-site to pass `Redacted.value` only where required and align with expected types (verify D.TS definitions).

4. **Boolean Response Normalisation**
   - Comparisons like `raw === true` on objects triggered TS2367. Should decode `raw` via schema, or map to explicit shape before decode (e.g., `typeof raw === "boolean" ? { success: raw } : raw`).

Fixing the above should leave the build green; re-run the command afterwards.

## 4. Immediate Next Actions for the Successor Agent

1. **Remove `as any` usage**
   - Search `admin.implementations.ts` for `as any`. Replace with precise typing by aligning payload schemas and Return types with the Better Auth client signatures.

2. **Refine Contract Schemas**
   - Revisit each schema causing issues (`AdminUser`, `AdminSession`, etc.). Prefer plain `S.String`, `S.Boolean`, etc., or wrap with `S.optional` rather than reusing model insert schemas that introduce optional defaults.
   - For permission payload validation, consider a helper `ensureExclusive` that runs in handler prior to calling the client, instead of encoding the rule in the schema.

3. **Synchronise Types Between Payloads and Client**
   - Inspect `node_modules/better-auth/dist/plugins/admin/index.d.ts` around each method to confirm exact parameter types.
   - Update contract payloads so encoded types match expectation (e.g., `role?: string | readonly string[]`, `banReason?: string | undefined`, etc.).

4. **Re-run Build**
   - After adjustments: `PATH="$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH" bun run build --filter=@beep/iam-sdk` (the PATH prefix is required; earlier runs showed `bun` missing otherwise).
   - Capture any remaining diagnostics in this file if new blockers appear.

## 5. Reference Tool Calls (Chronological Snapshot)

1. `jetbrains__get_file_text_by_path` – multiple invocations for agent guides, contracts, and implementation files.
2. `context7__resolve-library-id {"libraryName":"better-auth"}` – resolved library ID.
3. `context7__get-library-docs {"topic":"plugins/admin"}` – fetched admin plugin docs.
4. `jetbrains__search_in_files_by_text` – located `/admin` routes within `better-auth-api-spec.json`.
5. `jetbrains__execute_terminal_command` (Python snippets) – printed OpenAPI schemas, inspected bundled d.ts files.
6. `PATH="$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH" bun run build --filter=@beep/iam-sdk` – build attempt generating current error list.

Keep this log updated if more commands are run.

## 6. Noteworthy Constraints & Conventions

- No native array/string helpers; always use Effect collections – ensure any future edits respect this.
- `makeFailureContinuation` pattern is mandatory; propagate metadata `{ plugin: "admin", method: "..." }` for telemetry consistency.
- When calls mutate session state, notify `$sessionSignal` on success (already done for impersonation toggle).
- Avoid `as any` assertions per latest user directive.

## 7. Suggested Working Order for New Session

1. **Scan build errors** (see §3) to prioritise schema corrections.
2. **Update contract schemas** to simple `S.Struct` definitions that align with Better Auth outputs (start with `AdminUser` & `AdminSession`).
3. **Fix implementation typing** so casts disappear, aligning inputs with `adminClient` signatures.
4. **Refine permission payload rule** (schema or runtime check) to satisfy TypeScript.
5. **Run build** and iterate until green.
6. **Update `BETTER_AUTH_CLIENT_AND_METHODS_LIST.md`** admin section when contracts + implementations pass build (all checkboxes currently unchecked).

Feel free to append to this file as the effort progresses; it is intended to serve as the running log for admin client integration work.
