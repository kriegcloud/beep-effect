(# Admin Client Implementation Working Notes

These notes capture the state of the ongoing `@beep/iam-sdk` admin client work so a fresh GPT-5 Codex session can resume without re-discovering context. Follow the order below to rebuild understanding and recover momentum.

## 1. Source Material Consulted

| Topic | Reference | Tool Call |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Package orientation | `packages/iam/sdk/AGENTS.md` | `jetbrains__get_file_text_by_path` |
| Better Auth admin process | `BETTER_AUTH_CLIENT_METHOD_PROCESS.md` | `jetbrains__get_file_text_by_path` |
| Admin checklist (scope of methods) | `BETTER_AUTH_CLIENT_AND_METHODS_LIST.md` (admin section) | `jetbrains__get_file_text_by_path` |
| Better Auth official docs | `context7__get-library-docs {"topic":"plugins/admin"}` | `context7__get-library-docs` |
| Better Auth OpenAPI excerpt | `better-auth-api-spec.json` search for `/admin` endpoints | `jetbrains__execute_terminal_command` (Python snippets) |
| Client plugin type definitions | `node_modules/better-auth/dist/client/plugins/index.d.ts` + `.mjs` | `jetbrains__execute_terminal_command` (print excerpts) |
| Server plugin types (UserWithRole, payloads) | `node_modules/better-auth/dist/plugins/admin/index.d.ts` | `jetbrains__execute_terminal_command` |

Keep these files open; they contain the canonical shapes for request/response payloads used while modelling the contracts.

## 2. Current Edit State

### 2.1 Contracts (`packages/iam/sdk/src/clients/admin/admin.contracts.ts`)
- Added comprehensive schemas for every admin endpoint.
- Introduced shared structures (`AdminUser`, `AdminSession`, etc.).
- Schemas now rely on local primitives (`AdminUserId`, `AdminRoleValue`); cross-slice dependencies on `@beep/shared-domain` have been removed.

### 2.2 Implementations (`packages/iam/sdk/src/clients/admin/admin.implementations.ts`)
- All admin methods wired through `makeFailureContinuation`, full decode/notify logic.
- `as any` has been removed across the current admin handlers; response decoding now consistently uses `requireData` + `decodeResult` (including stop impersonating, revoke/remove flows, and permission checks).
- Session-mutation handlers notify `$sessionSignal`.

No other files touched beyond the new working notes.

## 3. Build Status

Command: `PATH="$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH" bun run build --filter=@beep/iam-sdk`

Outcome: **passing** (latest run).

---

## 4. Immediate Next Actions for the Successor Agent

1. Audit `BETTER_AUTH_CLIENT_AND_METHODS_LIST.md` to mark completed admin methods and choose the next batch (e.g., ban/unban UI integration or remaining checklist items).
2. Evaluate consumer surfaces (runtime/UI) that should start wiring these admin contracts, noting any missing atoms/hooks before implementation begins.
3. Maintain the build gate (`PATH="$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH" bun run build --filter=@beep/iam-sdk`) after each batch and record findings here.

---

## 5. Reference Tool Calls (Chronological Snapshot)

1. `jetbrains__get_file_text_by_path` – multiple invocations for agent guides, contracts, and implementation files.
2. `context7__resolve-library-id {"libraryName":"better-auth"}` – resolved library ID.
3. `context7__get-library-docs {"topic":"plugins/admin"}` – fetched admin plugin docs.
4. `jetbrains__search_in_files_by_text` – located `/admin` routes within `better-auth-api-spec.json`.
5. `jetbrains__execute_terminal_command` (Python snippets) – printed OpenAPI schemas, inspected bundled d.ts files.
6. `PATH="$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH" bun run build --filter=@beep/iam-sdk` – build attempt generating current error list.

Keep this log updated if more commands are run.

## 6. Noteworthy Constraints & Conventions

- No native array/string helpers; always use Effect collections – ensure any future edits respect this.
- `makeFailureContinuation` pattern is mandatory; propagate metadata `{ plugin: "admin", method: "..." }` for telemetry consistency.
- When calls mutate session state, notify `$sessionSignal` on success (already done for impersonation toggle).
- Avoid `as any` assertions per latest user directive.

---

## 7. Suggested Working Order for New Session

1. **Scan build errors** (see §3) to prioritise schema corrections.
2. **Update contract schemas** to simple `S.Struct` definitions that align with Better Auth outputs (start with `AdminUser` & `AdminSession`).
3. **Fix implementation typing** so casts disappear, aligning inputs with `adminClient` signatures.
4. **Refine permission payload rule** (schema or runtime check) to satisfy TypeScript.
5. **Run build** and iterate until green.
6. **Update `BETTER_AUTH_CLIENT_AND_METHODS_LIST.md`** admin section when contracts + implementations pass build (all checkboxes currently unchecked).

Feel free to append to this file as the effort progresses; it is intended to serve as the running log for admin client integration work.

## 8. Progress Log

- **Batch 1 — `setRole`, `getUser`, `createUser` (current session)**  
  - Normalised admin contract schemas to use local `AdminUserId`/`S.*` primitives (removed `SharedEntityIds` dependency); constrained `AdminRole` to `"user" | "admin"`.  
  - Updated the three handlers to drop every `as any`, build request objects with typed spreads, and reuse typed `FetchOptions`. Added explicit failure typing via `InstanceType<typeof IamError>` and tightened `decodeResult`.  
  - Build command: `PATH="$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH" bun run build --filter=@beep/iam-sdk` (fails).  
    - Resolved earlier schema errors; remaining blockers include `decodeResult` still inferred as `Effect<any, never, unknown>` (`admin.implementations.ts:78`) plus downstream handlers that have not been retyped yet (`StopImpersonating`, revoke/remove flows, `hasPermission`).  
  - Next batch should address the remaining handlers’ typing (ensure each returns `Effect<Success, IamError, never>` and eliminate `ParseError` leakage) before retrying the build.
- **Batch 2 — `updateUser`, `listUsers`, `listUserSessions` (current session)**  
  - Reworked `decodeResult` to use `S.decodeUnknownSync` through `Effect.try`/`Effect.orDieWith`, eliminating the `unknown` environment channel.  
  - Retyped the three handlers to rely on `Parameters<typeof client.admin.*>[0]` request shapes; removed the remaining `as any` usage and kept `makeFailureContinuation` metadata intact.  
  - Build command: `PATH="$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH" bun run build --filter=@beep/iam-sdk` (fails).  
    - Outstanding diagnostics now limited to `AdminStopImpersonatingHandler` (parameter typed as `{}`) plus `AdminRemoveUserHandler` and `AdminHasPermissionHandler` leaking `ParseError`. Next batch should widen the stop-impersonating payload and route both boolean/permission responses through `decodeResult`.
- **Batch 3 — `stopImpersonating`, `removeUser`, `hasPermission` (current session)**  
  - Annotated `AdminStopImpersonatingHandler` with the contract success type while widening its parameter to `unknown`, keeping the `$sessionSignal` notification and avoiding the `{}` signature error.  
  - Refactored `AdminRemoveUserHandler` and `AdminHasPermissionHandler` to reuse `requireData`/`decodeResult`; the latter now enforces XOR semantics between `permission` and `permissions` to raise `IamError` on invalid payloads.  
  - Build command: `PATH="$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH" bun run build --filter=@beep/iam-sdk` (passes).  
- **Batch 4 — `revokeUserSession`, `revokeUserSessions` (current session)**  
  - Migrated both revoke handlers to the shared `requireData` + `decodeResult` helpers, eliminating custom `ParseError` catch blocks while preserving failure typing.  
  - Build command: `PATH="$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH" bun run build --filter=@beep/iam-sdk` (passes).
