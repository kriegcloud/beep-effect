# Implementation Profile

## Objective
Apply approved mappings with minimal drift.

## Required behavior
- Direct ports: preserve semantics.
- Adaptations: log drift and mitigation.
- Deferred items: provide fallback + owner/status.

## Deliverable
Implemented files plus implementation report with file-level evidence.
