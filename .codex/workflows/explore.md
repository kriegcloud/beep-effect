# Explore Workflow (Codex Adaptation)

Adapted from `.claude/commands/explore.md` into a tool-agnostic investigation protocol.

## Procedure

1. Decompose question into 3-6 orthogonal tracks.
2. Investigate each track independently.
3. Aggregate convergent findings and divergences.
4. Report unified conclusion with explicit gaps.

## Evidence rules

- Every substantive claim includes file path evidence.
- Unknowns remain explicit; do not infer without support.
