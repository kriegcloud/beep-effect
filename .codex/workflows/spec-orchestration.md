# Spec Orchestration Workflow

Canonical source: `specs/codex-claude-parity/MASTER_ORCHESTRATION.md`

## Condensed execution checklist

1. Enforce phase gates: Entry -> Work -> Exit -> Quality.
2. Keep non-direct mappings explicit with rationale.
3. Require evidence for all scenario validations.
4. Maintain handoff pair discipline per completed phase.
5. Do not claim parity with unresolved critical blockers.
