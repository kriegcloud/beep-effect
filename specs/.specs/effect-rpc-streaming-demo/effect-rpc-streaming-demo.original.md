# Original Prompt

I want to try out `@effect/rpc` with streaming support in apps/web. I want you to create a very simple `RpcGroup` with stream enabled and create a web handler for support in nextjs. Additionally an app router page should be created with a `@effect/platform/HttpClient` so that the rpc implementation can be tested end to end.
