## Original Request

I want you to create a new agent spec in specs/agents for another stance of claude to orchestrate the research, planning & implementation of a new agent called ai-trends-researcher.

the `ai-trends-researcher` will be an expert at performing tasks like
1. use the web to research:
 - emerging trends
 - context management techniques
 - prompting frameworks
 - agentic workflows
 - prompting best practices
 - context engineering best practices
 - plugins, claude code updates
 - claude code features
 - claude code best practices
 - docker mcp toolkit
 - technologies
 - tools
 - mcp servers
 - agentic coding harness best practices
 - agent system prompt best practices
 - repository ai friendliness best practices
2. write and produce research reports which will be consumed by existing agents to improve performance of agents contributing to this repo. Reports might be tailored to existing agents like
 - .claude/agents/agents-md-updater.md
 - .claude/agents/mcp-researcher.md
 - .claude/agents/prompt-refiner.md
 - .claude/agents/reflector.md
 - .claude/agents/spec-reviewer.md

3. create claude code skills, rules, commands, agents
4. provide recommendations & improvement oppertunities  which can be made to agent related documents in this repo
5. compare and contrast this repositories .claude configuration with the latest trends & best practices then refactoring them to make sure they are on the bleeding edge.

It is important that this agent has a compressed data set of keywords, search terms, websites, blogs, documentation links or other sources of information which will assist and make it easy for it to find the latest and greatest information to these ends.

before creating the new spec I recommend that you launch several web-researcher's to compile a set of quality sources, tool calls examples, quality keywords/buzzwords and other information which will assist in the creation of this spec.
