# Spec Reviewer Agent: Reflection Log

## Reflection Protocol

After each phase completion, add an entry documenting:
1. What worked well (keep doing)
2. What didn't work (stop doing)
3. Methodology improvements (start doing)
4. Prompt refinements (before → problem → after)
5. Spec-specific insights (patterns discovered)

## Reflection Entries

### 2026-01-11 - Phase 0: Initial Creation

#### What Worked
- Parallel research agents gathered comprehensive context efficiently
- Web search for context engineering best practices provided modern patterns
- Existing agent specs (architecture-pattern-enforcer, code-reviewer) provided good structural templates

#### What Didn't Work
- N/A (initial creation)

#### Methodology Improvements
- [ ] After testing, refine rubric weights based on actual spec review outcomes
- [ ] Consider adding automated file counting for validation

#### Prompt Refinements
N/A (initial creation)

#### Codebase-Specific Insights
- ai-friendliness-audit/META_SPEC_TEMPLATE.md is the gold standard for spec evolution
- flexlayout-type-safety demonstrates proper handoff protocol
- Context engineering principles (hierarchical structure, progressive disclosure) align well with spec design

## Accumulated Improvements

### Agent Definition Updates
- (To be added after Phase 4 validation)

### Rubric Calibration
- (To be added after testing on multiple specs)

### Detection Heuristics
- (To be added based on common issues found)
