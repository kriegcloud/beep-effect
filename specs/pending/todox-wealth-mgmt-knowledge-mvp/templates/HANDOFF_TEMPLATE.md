# Handoff P[N] Template

## Spec

- Name: `[spec-name]`
- Location: `specs/pending/[spec-name]`

## Phase Goal

- `[one sentence: what this phase is trying to accomplish]`

## Context for Phase [N]

### Working Context (keep short)

- Current task: `[what must be done next]`
- Success criteria: `[pass/fail bullets]`
- Blocking issues: `[if any]`
- Immediate dependencies: `[files/services/packages]`

### Episodic Context (what just happened)

- Prior phase outcome: `[1-2 sentences]`
- Key decisions made: `[bullets]`

### Semantic Context (invariants)

- Scope and non-goals: `[verbatim bullets]`
- Evidence/integrity invariants: `[e.g., evidence spans must include docId+offsets]`

### Procedural Context (links only)

- Spec guide: `specs/_guide/README.md`
- Handoff standards: `specs/_guide/HANDOFF_STANDARDS.md`

## Completed Work

- `[bullets of what changed]`

## Current State

- `[what exists now, what is still missing]`

## Next Steps

1. `[next action]`
2. `[next action]`

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Record exact commands and PASS/FAIL + date after execution.
```

## Handoff Gate (Explicit)

- When context feels ~50% consumed (or before large/risky work), STOP and checkpoint this handoff + next-phase prompt even if the phase is not complete.
