# OVERVIEW Legacy Knowledge Integration Exploration

## 1. Purpose and Reading Guide
- **Intent**: exploratory synthesis of legacy `knowledge/_docs` ideas/patterns/systems and their possible integration value for the current repo-codegraph-jsdoc direction in [OVERVIEW.md](./OVERVIEW.md).
- **Outcome type**: opportunities and recommended exploratory lanes, not implementation commitments.
- **Claim labeling contract**:
  - `Implemented (Legacy Verified)`
  - `Specified (Legacy Planned)`
  - `Conceptual Opportunity (Current System)`
- **How to read**:
  1. Sections 3-7 reconstruct legacy reality.
  2. Sections 8-14 map and prioritize opportunities.
  3. Sections 15-20 seed next-spec drafting.

## 16. Risks, Dependencies, and Preconditions
| Risk/Dependency | Condition | Mitigation | Claim Tag | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Over-extension of reasoning scope | full OWL applied indiscriminately | profile-gate reasoning (`rdfs-*` first) + scale thresholds | `Conceptual Opportunity (Current System)` | `.repos/beep-effect/packages/knowledge/_docs/ontology_research/REASONING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` |
| Conflict between new opportunities and canonical lock defaults | introducing patterns that alter locked assumptions | use explicit ADR flags before altering lock surfaces | `Conceptual Opportunity (Current System)` | `./OVERVIEW.md`, `.repos/beep-effect/packages/knowledge/_docs/INDEX.md` |
| Event-stream design without consumer surfaces | server emits events but client/ui cannot consume meaningfully | keep envelope design, defer UX commitments; model as operational telemetry first | `Conceptual Opportunity (Current System)` | `.repos/beep-effect/packages/knowledge/client/src/index.ts`, `.repos/beep-effect/packages/knowledge/ui/src/index.ts`, `.repos/beep-effect/packages/knowledge/_docs/PROGRESS_STREAMING_SUMMARY.md` |

---

## 17. Non-Goals and Boundaries
- This document does **not** prescribe immediate code implementation.
- This document does **not** rewrite canonical lock defaults in `repo-codegraph-canonical`.
- This document does **not** commit to adopting all top-ranked opportunities.
- This document does **not** settle final data-model migrations (claim lifecycle, external reasoners, UI roadmap).

Each statement above is `Conceptual Opportunity (Current System)` bounded by exploratory intent.
Evidence: `./OVERVIEW.md` and user-scoped objective for exploratory synthesis.

### 18.1 Top-Ranked Opportunity Prompts

All ADR prompts: `Conceptual Opportunity (Current System)`.
