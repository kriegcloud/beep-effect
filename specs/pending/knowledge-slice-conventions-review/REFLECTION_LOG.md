## Entry 1: Spec Scaffolding (2026-02-07)

### Phase
Phase 0 - Scaffolding

### Notes
- Spec created to audit `packages/knowledge/*` for repo-convention alignment and to standardize data models on `effect/Schema` classes (`S.Class`) where appropriate.
- Execution rule: apply fixes as the orchestrator steps through modules (domain/tables/server/client/ui), not as an end-of-spec bulk refactor.
