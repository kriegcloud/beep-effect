- MASTER_ORCHESTRATION
- RUBRICS
- current HANDOFF_P[N]

Mission:
1. Complete phase objective
2. Produce required output artifacts
3. Run phase verification commands
4. Update reflection for this phase
5. Create dual handoff files for next phase

Hard constraints:
- preserve locked product decisions
- avoid unrelated refactors
- maintain deterministic behavior

Definition of done for phase:
- outputs complete
- verification green
- reflection updated
- next handoff pair created
