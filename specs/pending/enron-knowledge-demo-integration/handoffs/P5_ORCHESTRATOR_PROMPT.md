You are implementing Phase 5 for `enron-knowledge-demo-integration`.

Read first:
- `specs/pending/enron-knowledge-demo-integration/README.md`
- `specs/pending/enron-knowledge-demo-integration/MASTER_ORCHESTRATION.md`
- `specs/pending/enron-knowledge-demo-integration/RUBRICS.md`
- `specs/pending/enron-knowledge-demo-integration/handoffs/HANDOFF_P5.md`

Mission:
1. Run strict `spec-reviewer` and iterate until the latest review score is exactly `5.0/5`.
2. Ensure all reflection sections are concrete and artifact-grounded.
3. Ensure dual handoff chain (P1-P5) is complete and context-budget-compliant.
4. Ensure delegation evidence log is complete.
5. Prepare closure handoff documents.

Required outputs:
- `specs/pending/enron-knowledge-demo-integration/outputs/spec-review.md`
- `specs/pending/enron-knowledge-demo-integration/handoffs/HANDOFF_COMPLETE.md`
- `specs/pending/enron-knowledge-demo-integration/handoffs/COMPLETE_ORCHESTRATOR_PROMPT.md`

Hard constraints:
- no speculative claims about verification that was not run
- preserve existing approved scope; no new feature additions in closure phase
- keep recommendations prioritized and actionable

Verification:
- run check/test gates for touched packages in this phase and capture summaries

Then update:
- final closure notes in `REFLECTION_LOG.md`
- status in main spec docs if transition-ready
