## 1) Read the README

- `specs/pending/enron-knowledge-demo-integration/README.md`

## 2) Start from the Phase 1 Handoff + Prompt

- `specs/pending/enron-knowledge-demo-integration/handoffs/HANDOFF_P1.md`
- `specs/pending/enron-knowledge-demo-integration/handoffs/P1_ORCHESTRATOR_PROMPT.md`

## 3) Produce Discovery Outputs

Minimum recommended for medium+ specs:

- `outputs/codebase-context.md`

## 4) Execute In Small Checkpoints

- Update `REFLECTION_LOG.md` after each phase or major checkpoint.
- If you approach context limits, create a new handoff + orchestrator prompt per `specs/_guide/HANDOFF_STANDARDS.md`.
