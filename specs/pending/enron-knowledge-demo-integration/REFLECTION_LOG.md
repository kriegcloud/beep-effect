# enron-knowledge-demo-integration: Reflection Log

> Cumulative learnings from spec creation and implementation phases.

---

## Reflection Protocol

After each phase, document:

1. **What Worked** - Techniques that were effective
2. **What Didn't Work** - Approaches that failed or were inefficient
3. **Methodology Improvements** - Changes to apply in future phases
4. **Prompt Refinements** - Updated prompts based on learnings
5. **Codebase-Specific Insights** - Patterns unique to this repo

## Reflection Entries

### P0: Scaffolding (Fill This In)

1. **What Worked**
   - *(e.g. what structure/templates helped? what was unclear?)*
2. **What Didn't Work**
   - *(e.g. missing handoffs, missing prompts, unclear success criteria)*
3. **Methodology Improvements**
   - *(e.g. changes to apply to future specs/templates)*
4. **Prompt Refinements**
   - *(e.g. how to improve orchestrator/sub-agent prompts)*
5. **Codebase-Specific Insights**
   - *(e.g. discovered conventions, tools, verification commands)*

After P0, run the spec-reviewer rubric and fix gaps before implementation.
