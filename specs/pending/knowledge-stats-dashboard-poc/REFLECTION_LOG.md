# Reflection Log: Knowledge Stats Dashboard POC

This log is updated at the end of each phase with what worked, what failed, and what to change in prompts/process.

## Phase 0 (Scaffolding)

- Created initial spec structure and orchestration docs.
- Noted a tooling hazard: Notion `collection://…` identifiers are not consistently queryable via MCP/Notion APIs; prefer page IDs + local capture outputs.

TBD

## Phase 2 (Schema & Contracts)

TBD

## Phase 3 (Server Implementation)

TBD

## Phase 4 (UI Components)

TBD

## Phase 5 (Integration & Polish)
