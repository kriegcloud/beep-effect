# Reflection Log: Knowledge Stats Dashboard POC

This log is updated at the end of each phase with what worked, what failed, and what to change in prompts/process.

## Phase 0 (Scaffolding)

- Created initial spec structure and orchestration docs.
- Noted a tooling hazard: Notion `collection://…` identifiers are not consistently queryable via MCP/Notion APIs; prefer page IDs + local capture outputs.
- Validated (via Playwright MCP on 2026-02-07) the sign-in flow at `/auth/sign-in` and confirmed the signed-in shell includes a `Knowledge Base` tab; the dashboard in this spec should be attached to that tab.
