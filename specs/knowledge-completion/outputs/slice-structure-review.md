# Slice Structure Review

> Generated by: `architecture-pattern-enforcer` agent in Phase 2
> Status: PENDING

## Purpose

Validate that `packages/knowledge/*` follows the vertical slice architecture.

## Expected Content

### Domain Package Validation

- [ ] No Effect services (types/schemas only)
- [ ] No database imports
- [ ] No I/O operations
- [ ] Exports: entities, errors, schemas

### Tables Package Validation

- [ ] Drizzle table definitions only
- [ ] RLS policies present
- [ ] Depends only on: domain

### Server Package Validation

- [ ] Effect services present
- [ ] Business logic implemented
- [ ] Depends on: domain, tables

### Client Package Validation

- [ ] API wrappers only
- [ ] Depends only on: domain

### Dependency Direction

```
domain → tables → server
         ↓
       client
```

- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] No cross-slice violations

### Package Structure

```
packages/knowledge/
├── domain/          # Pure types, schemas, errors
├── tables/          # Drizzle definitions, RLS
├── server/          # Effect services
├── client/          # API wrappers
└── ui/              # React components (deferred)
```
