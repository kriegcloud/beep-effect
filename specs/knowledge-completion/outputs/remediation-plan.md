## Purpose

Prioritized list of fixes based on architecture review findings.

## Expected Content

### P0: Critical (Must fix before P4)

Violations that block refactoring:

| Issue | File | Fix |
|-------|------|-----|
| *To be populated* | - | - |

### P1: High Priority (Fix during P4)

Violations that should be fixed during refactoring:

| Issue | File | Fix |
|-------|------|-----|
| Legacy `Context.GenericTag` | `AiService.ts` | Delete file (part of migration) |
| *Additional items* | - | - |

### P2: Low Priority (Fix in P8)

Violations that can wait until finalization:

| Issue | File | Fix |
|-------|------|-----|
| *To be populated* | - | - |

## Known Pre-existing Issues

These issues are expected based on current implementation:

1. **AiService uses `Context.GenericTag`** - Will be deleted in P4
2. **Missing test coverage** - Will be added in P5
3. **Documentation gaps** - Will be fixed in P8

---

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check for Context.GenericTag usage
grep -r "Context.GenericTag" packages/knowledge/server/src/

# Check for relative imports
grep -r "from \"\.\./\.\./\.\." packages/knowledge/

# Check for missing @beep/* aliases
grep -r "from \"\.\./" packages/knowledge/server/src/ | grep -v node_modules
```
