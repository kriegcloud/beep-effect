## How to Use This Log

After completing each phase:

1. Add a new entry under the appropriate phase section
2. Document what worked, what didn't, and what was learned
3. Include specific examples (file paths, code patterns)
4. Note any changes to the spec based on learnings
5. Update prompts in AGENT_PROMPTS.md if needed
