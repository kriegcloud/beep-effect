### Entry 001 — Spec Creation
**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Phase**: 0 (Scaffolding)
**Author**: Orchestrator

**Context**:
Created spec based on Michael Arnaldi's recommendations for enhancing AI agent performance in Effect-first codebases.

**What Worked**:
- Analyzed existing repo infrastructure before designing solution
- Identified gaps vs. recommendations (subtrees, context, index)
- Leveraged existing spec guide patterns

**What Didn't Work**:
- N/A (initial creation)

**Pattern Candidates**:
- **Library Context Pattern**: Git subtrees + generated context files for deep library understanding
- **Navigation Index Pattern**: Centralized linking of all agent resources
