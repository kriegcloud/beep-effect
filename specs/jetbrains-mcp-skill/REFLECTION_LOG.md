## Spec Initialization

**Date**: 2026-01-21
**Complexity Classification**: Medium (4 phases, multi-session expected)

### Initial Assumptions

1. JetBrains MCP server is accessible when IDE is running
2. Tools have consistent parameter patterns (projectPath, timeout, truncateMode)
3. A single skill file (~200-300 lines) will be sufficient
4. Similar pattern to existing `playwright-mcp.md` skill will work well

### Rationale for Medium Complexity

- **4 phases**: Discovery, Analysis, Design, Implementation, Validation
- **Multi-session expected**: Tool research + comparison analysis + skill writing
- **Agent coordination**: codebase-researcher, mcp-researcher, doc-writer, reflector
- **Handoffs required**: Context preservation between research and implementation

### Key Risks

1. JetBrains MCP documentation may be sparse - requires empirical testing
2. Tool behavior may differ across JetBrains IDEs (WebStorm vs IntelliJ vs PyCharm)
3. Comparison with standard Claude Code tools requires careful benchmarking
