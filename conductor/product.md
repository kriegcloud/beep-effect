# Product Guide: Effect Ontology

## Initial Concept
A functional, type-safe system for extracting structured knowledge graphs from unstructured text using ontology-guided LLM prompting. Built with Effect-TS, implementing a mathematically rigorous pipeline based on topological catamorphism and monoid folding.

## Target Audience
- **Primary:** Data Scientists and Knowledge Engineers who are building and refining domain-specific ontologies.
- **Primary:** Software Developers who need to integrate reliable, ontology-guided knowledge extraction into their applications.
- **Secondary (Future):** End-users who will explore and interact with the extracted knowledge graphs via a web interface.

## Core Value Proposition
- **Mathematical Rigor:** Uses topological catamorphism and monoid folding to ensure deterministic, type-safe prompt generation and knowledge assembly.
- **Ontology-Driven:** The extraction process is strictly guided by OWL ontologies, ensuring that output data conforms to defined schemas.
- **Effect-Native:** Leverages the Effect ecosystem for robust error handling, dependency injection, and structured concurrency.
- **Platform Vision:** Acts as a foundational layer for future neurosymbolic reasoning, agent creation, and workflow automation based on domain-specific ontologies.

## Immediate Goals (Phase 1 Focus)
- **Stabilize Core Pipeline:** rigorous validation of the extraction logic within `@core-v2`.
- **High-Fidelity Extraction:** Continue refining the ontology-guided extraction to produce "rock solid" datasets.
- **Domain Validation:** Verify the system against complex, domain-specific ontologies to ensure broad applicability.

## Long-Term Vision
- **Agent Generation:** Use built ontologies to guide the creation of domain-specific agents.
- **Workflow Automation:** Enable ontology-driven workflow definition and execution.
- **Neurosymbolic Reasoning:** Provide tooling that bridges the gap between LLM probabilistic generation and symbolic logic.
- **Automated Ontology Refinement:** Tools for automated fact generation and professional-grade ontology construction.
