/**
 * Export Playground
 *
 * Package: effect
 * Module: effect/PubSub
 * Export: BackPressureStrategy
 * Kind: class
 * Source: .repos/effect-smol/packages/effect/src/PubSub.ts
 * Generated: 2026-02-19T04:14:15.990Z
 *
 * Overview:
 * A strategy that applies back pressure to publishers when the `PubSub` is at capacity. This guarantees that all subscribers will receive all messages published to the `PubSub` while they are subscribed. However, it creates the risk that a slow subscriber will slow down the rate at which messages are published and received by other subscribers.
 *
 * Source JSDoc Example:
 * (No inline example was found in the source JSDoc.)
 *
 * Focus:
 * - Class export exploration with focused runtime examples.
