# beep-effect codebase Development Patterns

## 🎯 PURPOSE
This directory provides reusable solutions and best practices for Effect TypeScript development, ensuring consistency and quality across the beep-effect codebase.

## 📚 AVAILABLE PATTERNS

### Core Development Patterns
- **[beep-effect-repository-development.md](beep-effect-repository-development.md)** - Fundamental patterns for beep-effect codebase development
- **[error-handling.md](./error-handling.md)** - Structured error management with Effect

### Documentation Patterns
- **[jsdoc-documentation.md](./jsdoc-documentation.md)** - JSDoc documentation standards and examples

### Testing Patterns
- **[testing-patterns.md](./testing-patterns.md)** - Testing strategies with @beep/testkit and effect/TestClock

## 🔧 HOW TO USE

### For Developers
1. **Reference before implementing** - Check relevant patterns before starting new work
2. **Follow established conventions** - Use patterns as templates for consistency
3. **Contribute improvements** - Update patterns based on lessons learned

### For Code Reviews
1. **Validate pattern compliance** - Ensure implementations follow established patterns
2. **Identify pattern violations** - Look for anti-patterns and forbidden practices
3. **Suggest pattern usage** - Recommend appropriate patterns for specific use cases

### For Documentation
1. **Extract reusable patterns** - Identify common solutions for documentation
2. **Update patterns** - Keep patterns current with library evolution
3. **Cross-reference examples** - Link patterns to real codebase examples

## 🚨 CRITICAL PRINCIPLES

### Forbidden Patterns (NEVER USE)
- **try-catch in Effect.gen**: Breaks Effect's error handling semantics
- **Type assertions**: `as any`, `as never`, `as unknown` hide type errors
- **Unsafe patterns**: Any pattern that bypasses Effect's type safety

### Mandatory Patterns (ALWAYS USE)
- **return yield* for errors**: Makes termination explicit in generators
- **Immediate linting**: `bun lint:fix` after editing TypeScript files
- **JSDoc compilation validation**: `bun run docgen` must pass
- **Effect testing patterns**: Use @beep/testkit with `it.effect`
- **TestClock for time**: Use TestClock for any time-dependent operations
