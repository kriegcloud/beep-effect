# Git Worktrees In `beep-effect`

This repo now uses **Git-native sibling worktrees** as the default way to do parallel feature work.

The goal is to replace duplicate full clones like `beep-effect2` and `beep-effect3` with multiple working directories that share one Git object database but keep separate branches, indexes, local caches, and IDE state.

## Workspace Layout

Canonical paths for this machine:

- Main checkout: `/home/elpresidank/YeeBois/projects/beep-effect`
- Worktree root: `/home/elpresidank/YeeBois/projects/beep-effect-worktrees`
- Starter worktree: `/home/elpresidank/YeeBois/projects/beep-effect-worktrees/playground`

Why this layout:

- It keeps worktrees **outside** the main repo directory.
- That matches current WebStorm guidance for Git worktrees.
- It avoids the nested-worktree layout Claude Code uses by default with `claude --worktree`.

## What A Worktree Actually Is

`git worktree` lets one Git repository expose multiple working directories at once.

Important rules:

- The main checkout is already a worktree.
- All worktrees share the same Git history and object store.
- Each worktree has its own checked-out branch, working directory, and index.
- A branch can only be checked out in **one** worktree at a time.
- Deleting a worktree directory by hand leaves stale metadata behind. Prefer `git worktree remove`, then `git worktree prune`.

## Everyday Commands

List all worktrees:

```bash
git -C /home/elpresidank/YeeBois/projects/beep-effect worktree list
```

Create a new sibling worktree from `main`:

```bash
git -C /home/elpresidank/YeeBois/projects/beep-effect \
  worktree add /home/elpresidank/YeeBois/projects/beep-effect-worktrees/feature-x \
  -b worktree/feature-x \
  main
```

Create a worktree for an existing branch:

```bash
git -C /home/elpresidank/YeeBois/projects/beep-effect \
  worktree add /home/elpresidank/YeeBois/projects/beep-effect-worktrees/beepgraph \
  feat/beepgraph-messaging
```

Remove a worktree cleanly:

```bash
git -C /home/elpresidank/YeeBois/projects/beep-effect \
  worktree remove /home/elpresidank/YeeBois/projects/beep-effect-worktrees/feature-x
```

Prune stale metadata:

```bash
git -C /home/elpresidank/YeeBois/projects/beep-effect worktree prune
```

Lock a long-lived worktree so Git will not prune it accidentally:

```bash
git -C /home/elpresidank/YeeBois/projects/beep-effect \
  worktree lock /home/elpresidank/YeeBois/projects/beep-effect-worktrees/playground
```

Repair broken metadata if a path moved:

```bash
git -C /home/elpresidank/YeeBois/projects/beep-effect worktree repair
```

## `beep-effect` Workflow

Recommended flow for a new feature:

1. Start from the main checkout and make sure `main` is clean.
2. Add a sibling worktree under `/home/elpresidank/YeeBois/projects/beep-effect-worktrees`.
3. Open that worktree as its own project in WebStorm.
4. Run bootstrap commands inside that worktree.
5. Launch Claude Code or Codex CLI from that worktree root.

Bootstrap checklist for a fresh worktree:

```bash
git -C /home/elpresidank/YeeBois/projects/beep-effect-worktrees/playground submodule update --init --recursive
cd /home/elpresidank/YeeBois/projects/beep-effect-worktrees/playground
bun install
```

Then restore any local-only files you need:

- `.env`
- `.direnv`
- `.claude/settings.local.json`
- `CLAUDE.local.md`
- `.beep`
- `.idea`

By default these do **not** follow you into a fresh worktree, which is usually what we want.

## Tool Integrations

### WebStorm

Default recommendation:

- Open each worktree as a **separate WebStorm project**.
- Do not treat sibling worktrees as attached subprojects inside one parent workspace.
- Do not nest worktrees inside `beep-effect/`.

Why:

- JetBrains documents worktree support as a single-repo project flow.
- Nested worktrees can be misdetected as multi-root projects.
- Separate projects keep changelists, run configs, branch state, and indexing cleaner.

Two good ways to create or open them:

- Use `git worktree add ...` in the terminal, then `File | Open`.
- Or use `Git | New Worktree` in WebStorm and let it open the new project.

### Claude Code

Default recommendation for this repo:

- Use manual Git worktrees.
- Launch Claude from the worktree root.
- Keep using the checked-in `.claude/settings.json` and `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` hook paths.

Good:

```bash
cd /home/elpresidank/YeeBois/projects/beep-effect-worktrees/playground
claude
```

Avoid as the primary local workflow:

```bash
claude --worktree
```

Why:

- Claude’s built-in worktree flow creates nested worktrees under `.claude/worktrees/`.
- That is convenient for quick disposable sessions, but it conflicts with the sibling layout that WebStorm handles best.

Still useful to know:

- Tracked `.claude/settings.json`, `.mcp.json`, and hook scripts come along automatically in any worktree.
- Gitignored files like `.claude/settings.local.json`, `CLAUDE.local.md`, and `.env` do not.
- If you ever choose Claude-managed worktrees for throwaway tasks, `.worktreeinclude` can copy selected ignored files, but that is not part of the default `beep-effect` setup.

### Codex CLI

Default recommendation:

- Run one Codex session per worktree.
- Launch it from the worktree root, or use `-C`.

Good:

```bash
cd /home/elpresidank/YeeBois/projects/beep-effect-worktrees/playground
codex
```

Also good:

```bash
codex -C /home/elpresidank/YeeBois/projects/beep-effect-worktrees/playground
```

Why:

- Codex CLI is cwd-driven for config discovery, hooks, trust, and resume filtering.
- The repo’s checked-in `.codex/config.toml`, `AGENTS.md`, and SessionStart guidance already fit that model well.

### Codex App

The Codex app has first-class worktree support, but treat it as an **optional parallel-agent workflow**, not the source of truth for the local repo layout.

Important differences:

- App-managed worktrees live under `$CODEX_HOME/worktrees`.
- They may start in detached `HEAD`.
- The app uses handoff semantics between local and worktree tasks.

Recommended use here:

- Use Git-native sibling worktrees for your day-to-day local workspace.
- Use Codex app worktrees only when you specifically want OpenAI-managed parallel task orchestration.

## Migration From Duplicate Clones

Use this sequence instead of creating another `beep-effectN` clone:

1. Decide which branch or feature needs isolation.
2. Create a worktree under `/home/elpresidank/YeeBois/projects/beep-effect-worktrees`.
3. Bootstrap it.
4. Move your IDE and agent session into that worktree.
5. Retire the old duplicate clone only after the branch is merged or intentionally migrated.

For an existing duplicate clone:

1. Identify its active branch and any uncommitted work.
2. Create an equivalent worktree on that branch.
3. Verify the new worktree has the local env files and tooling you need.
4. Stop using the duplicate clone.
5. Archive or delete the duplicate clone only after you are confident nothing local-only is stranded there.

## Repo-Specific Gotchas

- `flake.nix` now derives its Bun cache name from the active worktree root, so each worktree gets its own cache namespace.
- `.claude/.hook-state.json`, `.idea`, `.turbo`, `.sst`, `.beep`, and `node_modules` are intentionally local to each worktree.
- The repo contains a Git submodule at `.agents/skills/effect-v4`; verify submodules in a fresh worktree before assuming every skill is available.
- The Graphiti proxy is machine-global enough that you can keep using the same helper commands across worktrees:
  - `bun run codex:hook:session-start`
  - `bun run graphiti:proxy`
  - `bun run graphiti:proxy:ensure`
