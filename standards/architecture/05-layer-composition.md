# Layer Composition

Effect v4 changes the layer-composition tradeoff.

In earlier Effect versions, providing layers required more caution because layer
composition and memoization behavior made global composition feel safer. That
encouraged runtime packages that merged many slice dependencies into broad
`DataAccess.layer` or `Persistence.layer` values.

In Effect v4, Layers are memoized by default. Slice-local composition is a
better default.

## The Problem With God Layers

God Layers centralize unrelated ownership:

```txt
runtime/server
  DataAccess.layer
    IamDb.layer
    BillingDb.layer
    EditorDb.layer
    ...
```

This makes every slice feel cheaper to wire at first and more expensive to
change later. The runtime package becomes a registry of unrelated product
adapters.

## Slice-Local Composition

Prefer:

```txt
packages/iam/server/src/Layer.ts
  composes iam use-cases
  composes iam config when present
  composes iam product port implementations
  composes iam tables
  composes repo drivers
```

The application entrypoint can still import `iam/server/Layer.ts`, but it
should not need to know every concept-level repository and driver inside the
slice. Config Layers fit this same local shape: the config package may expose
server/runtime-only `/layer` helpers, and server/client boundaries plus
top-level application entrypoint composition decides which Layers to provide.
`use-cases` and any future `shared/use-cases` package stop at the contract
surface; they do not export live Layer values.

Slice-to-slice direct imports across `domain`, `use-cases`, `server`, `tables`,
`client`, or `ui` packages of *different* slices are forbidden. Cross-slice
integration goes through emitted events or, after a real promotion, the future
`shared/use-cases` contract package.

## Context.Service Shape

Services should be explicit, small, and composed at the boundary:

````ts
import { $IamUseCasesId } from "@beep/identity";
import { Context, type Effect } from "effect";
import {
  MembershipNotFound,
  MembershipRevocationDenied,
  MembershipRevocationFailed,
} from "./Membership.errors.js";
import type { RevokeMembershipCommand } from "./Membership.commands.js";

const $I = $IamUseCasesId.create("entities/Membership/Membership.service");

/**
 * Service contract for membership lifecycle operations.
 *
 * @category services
 * @since 0.0.0
 */
export class MembershipService extends Context.Service<
  MembershipService,
  {
    readonly revoke: (
      command: RevokeMembershipCommand,
    ) => Effect.Effect<void, MembershipNotFound | MembershipRevocationDenied | MembershipRevocationFailed>;
  }
>()($I`MembershipService`) {}
````

Use-case packages stop at the contract. A server layer provides the live
implementation from its dependencies:

````ts
import { Effect, Layer } from "effect";
import * as O from "effect/Option";
import {
  MembershipNotFound,
  type RevokeMembershipCommand,
} from "@beep/iam-use-cases/public";
import {
  MembershipAccess,
  MembershipRepository,
  MembershipService,
} from "@beep/iam-use-cases/server";

/**
 * Live `MembershipService` Layer composed from its slice-local dependencies.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Composition is intentionally local: the Layer reads `MembershipAccess` and
 * `MembershipRepository` from context and stops at the use-case contract.
 * Higher-level layers wire dependencies in, not out.
 *
 * @category layers
 * @since 0.0.0
 */
export const MembershipServerLayer = Layer.effect(
  MembershipService,
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const access = yield* MembershipAccess;
    const repo = yield* MembershipRepository;

    return {
      revoke: Effect.fn("MembershipService.revoke")(function* (
        command: RevokeMembershipCommand,
      ) {
        yield* access.assertCanRevoke(command);
        const model = yield* repo.findById(command.membershipId).pipe(
          Effect.flatMap(
            O.match({
              onNone: () => Effect.fail(new MembershipNotFound()),
              onSome: Effect.succeed,
            }),
          ),
        );
        yield* model.revoke().pipe(Effect.flatMap(repo.save));
      }),
    };
  }),
);
````

The dependencies are explicit, but local. That is the key distinction.
Any port or domain failures raised inside the implementation are translated to
the public action-error union declared by the service contract before they cross
the use-case boundary; see `09-errors-across-boundaries.md` for the strict
translation rule.

Drivers may export boundary-local layer constructors, and config packages may
expose server/runtime-only `/layer` helpers, but package-local application
Layer composition still lives in `server` and `client`. Top-level application
entrypoints compose those package-local Layers.

## When A Higher-Level Layer Is Fine

Higher-level app composition is still necessary. The rule is scope:

- concept-level Layers compose one concept
- package-level Layers compose one package
- slice-level Layers compose one slice
- app-level Layers compose slices

App-level composition may live directly in an executable entrypoint or in an
app-local helper:

```txt
apps/<app>/src/runtime/Layer.ts
```

That helper is still app code, not a new monorepo package family. It imports
public slice/package Layers, runtime providers required by the app boundary,
and config/driver boundaries through approved public subpaths. It exports only
app-specific live Layers and app-specific test Layers or fixtures.

Framework apps remain app-local even when they contain reusable-looking helper
modules. Next.js and Tauri app tests import those helpers through `@/*`, not
through a public `@beep/<app>` package alias. Only runtime proof apps should
keep a package-like app API, because their purpose is to prove a runtime
contract at the workspace boundary.

**Private** = anything not exported through a canonical subpath (`/public`,
`/server`, `/secrets`, `/layer`, `/test`) of a package's public root. App-level
composition may import only from canonical subpaths; reaching past them into a
package's internal module structure is the boundary violation. (Same definition
is in `GLOSSARY.md` under "Private (in app-layer composition)".)

The God Layer rejection test is Boundary + Ownership. The smell is a runtime
Layer that reaches through slice boundaries and wires the private details of
many slices at once. A global config Layer that aggregates every slice's private
config is the same smell in configuration form.

Forbidden app composition shapes include:

- importing private concept-level slice internals
- re-exporting slice Layers through a convenience app barrel
- owning product policy, handlers, repositories, schedules, workflows, or
  cross-slice orchestration
- moving unrelated slice internals into a shared runtime package

### Side-by-side: God-Layer vs slice-local app composition

#### Bad — God Layer reaching past canonical subpaths

````ts
// apps/web/src/runtime/Layer.ts
import { MembershipRepositoryLive } from "@beep/iam-server/internal/MembershipRepository";
import { SubscriptionRepositoryLive } from "@beep/billing-server/internal/SubscriptionRepository";
import { OrgPolicyServiceLive } from "@beep/iam-server/internal/OrgPolicyService";
import { Layer } from "effect";

export const AppLayer = Layer.mergeAll(
  MembershipRepositoryLive,
  SubscriptionRepositoryLive,
  OrgPolicyServiceLive,
  // ...repeats for every slice the app uses
);
````

The app reaches into each slice's internal module structure, hand-wires
individual repositories and services, and becomes the runtime registry for
unrelated slices. Renaming or restructuring any slice's internals breaks this
file.

#### Good — App composes published slice Layers

````ts
// apps/web/src/runtime/Layer.ts
import { IamLive } from "@beep/iam-server/layer";
import { BillingLive } from "@beep/billing-server/layer";
import { Layer } from "effect";

/**
 * Application Layer composed from each slice's published `/layer` subpath.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The app composes slices, not concepts. Renaming a slice's internal
 * repository changes nothing here.
 *
 * @category layers
 * @since 0.0.0
 */
export const AppLayer = Layer.mergeAll(IamLive, BillingLive);
````

Each slice publishes a single live Layer from its `/layer` canonical subpath.
The slice owns its own composition; the app composes slices, not concepts.
Renaming a slice's internal repository changes nothing in `apps/web`.

**Diagnostic:** if `apps/<app>/src/runtime/Layer.ts` mentions a concept name
(e.g., `Membership`, `Subscription`), it has reached past the slice boundary.
Slice-local Layer composers are the only place a concept name appears in a
Layer wiring.
