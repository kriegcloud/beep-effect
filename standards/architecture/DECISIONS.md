# Architecture Decision Log

This log records closed architecture decisions for the hexagonal vertical slice
standard. Amend this file when the standard changes.

## 2026-04-21: Adopt Hexagonal Vertical Slice Architecture

- **Status:** Active

Decision:

beep-effect uses slice package families with domain, use-cases, optional config,
server, client, tables, and UI. Technical wrappers live outside slices in the
repo-level `drivers` family.

Rationale:

The repo needs fast experimentation without topology drift. Slice families keep
domain work modular while hexagonal boundaries prevent driver details from
leaking inward.

## 2026-04-21: Treat `shared` As A DDD Shared Kernel

- **Status:** Active

Decision:

The `shared` package family is cross-cutting shared-kernel language, not a
dumping ground.

Rationale:

Shared code is expensive because every slice can depend on it. It must stay
small, deliberate, and driver-neutral where possible.

## 2026-04-21: Add `use-cases` As A Canonical Slice Package

- **Status:** Active

Decision:

Use-cases are first-class. Product ports live in use-cases by default.

Rationale:

Domain should not own application ports, and server should not define the
product language it implements. Use-cases are the correct application boundary.

## 2026-04-21: Keep `tables` Canonical

- **Status:** Active

Decision:

`tables` remains a canonical package for product-specific persistence schema and
mapping.

Rationale:

Drivers own generic Drizzle/Postgres safety wrappers. Tables own slice-specific
persistence shape.

## 2026-04-21: Drivers Own Technical Capability Only

- **Status:** Active

Decision:

Driver packages expose dev-safe technical wrappers and low-level runtime
capabilities. Product port implementations belong in `server` by default.

Rationale:

Putting business repository implementations inside `drivers/drizzle` or
`drivers/postgres` makes drivers product-aware and leaks infrastructure
names into product topology.

## 2026-05-06: Allow Narrow Tooling-To-Driver Operational Adapters

- **Status:** Active

Decision:

Tooling packages may depend on driver packages when the tooling package is the
operational adapter for repository analytics, generation, migration, fixtures,
or CLI workflows that need a product-neutral external engine.

Rationale:

Some repo-operational workflows, such as durable AI metrics projections into
DuckDB, need a technical engine without becoming product runtime code. The
driver still owns the external API boundary; the tooling package owns the
repo-operational semantics and must declare the direct dependency/reference it
imports.

## 2026-04-21: Use Domain-Kind Folders

- **Status:** Active

Decision:

Domain concepts are grouped by `aggregates/`, `entities/`, and `values/`.
`policies/` and `services/` are escape hatches.

Rationale:

Domain-kind folders preserve DDD meaning and keep concept topology expressive
without flattening everything into one root.

## 2026-04-21: Use Concept-Qualified Role Suffixes

- **Status:** Active

Decision:

The canonical grammar is:

```txt
<package>/src/<domain-kind>/<Concept>/<Concept>.<role>.ts
```

Rationale:

The path tells readers the concept. The role suffix tells reviewers what the
file may do.

## 2026-04-21: Split Access From Policy

- **Status:** Active

Decision:

Use both `.access.ts` and `.policy.ts` where needed.

Rationale:

`access` means who may attempt an action on a resource. `policy` means what the
domain permits to be true.

## 2026-04-21: Prefer Hybrid Rich Domain Models

- **Status:** Active

Decision:

Domain models should own shape, validation, and pure behavior. Behavior can live
as model methods, exported functions, `*.behavior.ts`, and pure `*.policy.ts`.

Rationale:

Pure behavior near the domain concept reduces duplicated rules across use-cases,
handlers, client state, and UI.

## 2026-04-21: Reduce Runtime God Layers

- **Status:** Active

Decision:

Favor slice-local Layer composition over central runtime packages that merge all
similar slice dependencies.

Rationale:

Effect v4 memoized Layers make local composition practical. Slice-local Layers
preserve ownership and reduce cross-slice coupling.

## 2026-04-21: Keep Codegen And Linting Downstream

- **Status:** Active

Decision:

This standard defines architecture. Repo-cli, codegen, codemods, package
constraints, and lint rules are downstream enforcement mechanisms.

Rationale:

The architecture needs to be clear before enforcement is designed.

## 2026-04-21: Restrict Client-Safe Use-Case Imports

- **Status:** Superseded
- **Superseded-by:** [2026-04-23: Make Boundary-Sensitive Export Subpaths Canonical](#2026-04-23-make-boundary-sensitive-export-subpaths-canonical)

Decision:

Client packages may import use-case command/query language, driver-neutral
boundary contracts, driver-neutral DTOs, client-safe facade contracts, and
actionable application errors, but not product ports, server-only
service/facade contracts, workflows, process managers, schedulers, or live
Layer implementations.

Amended 2026-04-23: this client-safe contract is now taught through the
canonical `@beep/<slice>-use-cases/public` boundary.

Rationale:

The client needs shared application language without becoming coupled to
server-only orchestration or infrastructure contracts.

## 2026-04-21: Put Protocol Declarations In `use-cases`

- **Status:** Active

Decision:

Use-case `.http.ts`, `.rpc.ts`, `.tools.ts`, and `.cluster.ts` files define
driver-neutral protocol declarations. Implementations, handlers, clients,
runtime Layers, and transports belong in adapter packages.

Rationale:

The application boundary should own command/query and protocol language without
owning the runtime side effects that execute that language.

## 2026-04-22: Add `config` As An Optional Canonical-Shape Slice Package

- **Status:** Active

Decision:

`config` is the optional canonical-shape package kind for typed slice configuration.
Package names use `@beep/<slice>-config` and `@beep/<kernel>-config`.

Rationale:

Effect `Config` names a typed runtime contract, while environment variables are
only one possible source. A config package gives application tunables, public
config, server config, secrets, defaults, and config Layers a clear home without
leaking runtime reads into domain code.

## 2026-04-22: Treat `env` Package Naming As Legacy

- **Status:** Active

Decision:

`env` is source vocabulary, not architecture topology. Existing package names
such as `@beep/<kernel>-env` and paths such as `packages/<kernel>/config` should migrate
to `@beep/<kernel>-config` and `packages/<kernel>/config`.

Rationale:

Naming packages after the source encourages direct environment thinking. Naming
packages after config preserves the Effect `Config` abstraction and allows other
`ConfigProvider` sources.

## 2026-04-22: Keep Driver Config Driver-Local

- **Status:** Active

Decision:

Driver `.config.ts` files own technical driver knobs. Slice `config` packages
own application-facing config contracts. Server or client Layers may compose
slice config with driver config at adapter boundaries, but slice config
packages do not own driver internals.

Rationale:

Moving Drizzle, Postgres, EventLog, queue, or workflow-engine settings into a
slice config package would make the package a driver registry. Keeping
technical config driver-local preserves the driver boundary.

## 2026-04-23: Recast Provider Packages As Repo-Level Drivers

- **Status:** Active

Decision:

Third-party dev-safe wrappers live in flat repo-level drivers under
`packages/drivers/<name>`. Earlier drafts modeled them as slice-local
`providers`; this packet supersedes that model.

Rationale:

Technical wrappers are architecture-wide boundaries, not slice kinds and not
candidates for `shared`. Flat repo-level roots keep those boundaries visible
and keep `shared` focused on cross-slice product semantics.

## 2026-04-23: Driver Packages Use Short Capability Names

- **Status:** Active

Decision:

Driver packages use short public names such as `@beep/drizzle`,
`@beep/postgres`, and `@beep/<driver>`.

Rationale:

The driver role is already visible from the canonical root
`packages/drivers/<name>`. Repeating that role in the import path adds noise
without adding clarity.

## 2026-06-07: Generated SDK Drivers Prefer Regenerable Fidelity

- **Status:** Active

Decision:

Large SDK driver packages may generate schema and operation wrappers directly
from the installed SDK type declarations when the generated output is
reproducible and package-local. Generators should preserve precise schema
fidelity where the SDK exposes precise types, model forward-compatible open
enums explicitly, and fall back to `S.Unknown` for SDK `any`, unsupported
intersection refinements, uninspectable dynamic maps, and other shapes that
cannot be represented honestly without hand-written semantics.

Methods that carry byte streams, event streams, or SDK helper state may be
excluded from JSON operation generation and wrapped by a small hand-written
adapter surface. That adapter remains technical, driver-local, schema-first for
the representable fields, and covered by unit/type tests that pin the generated
and hand-written split.

Rationale:

SDK wrappers need broad method coverage without hand-authoring thousands of
schemas. A generator-first driver gives the repo a repeatable upgrade path and
keeps the SDK boundary honest: precise types stay precise, future enum values
decode where the SDK contract is open, and ambiguous SDK declarations remain
`Unknown` instead of pretending to be domain language. The hand-written stream
escape hatch keeps non-JSON runtime behavior explicit without turning the whole
driver into bespoke code.

## 2026-04-23: Add Explicit Non-Slice Artifact Families

- **Status:** Superseded
- **Superseded by:** [2026-05-01: Retire Assistant Bundles From Architecture](#2026-05-01-retire-assistant-bundles-from-architecture)

Decision:

Non-slice architecture uses four canonical families:

- `foundation` for domain-agnostic reusable substrate
- `drivers` for flat repo-level external boundary wrappers
- `tooling` for developer-operational code packages
- `agents` for repo-local AI steering bundles

`shared` remains the DDD shared kernel. It is not renamed to `foundation`, and
it is not a synonym for `common`, `core`, or `misc`.

Rationale:

The repo needs reusable artifacts that are not slices, but those artifacts
still need topology that compresses context for humans and agents. Naming
families explicitly prevents generic buckets from becoming junk drawers.

## 2026-04-23: Give Every Non-Slice Artifact A Family And, When Applicable, A Kind

- **Status:** Superseded
- **Superseded by:** [2026-05-01: Retire Assistant Bundles From Architecture](#2026-05-01-retire-assistant-bundles-from-architecture)

Decision:

Every non-slice artifact declares exactly one canonical family. Kind remains
required only for families that intentionally declare a kind segment.

- `foundation`: `primitive`, `modeling`, `capability`, `ui-system`
- `drivers`: flat family with no extra kind segment
- `tooling`: `library`, `tool`, `policy-pack`, `test-kit`
- `agents`: `skill-pack`, `policy-pack`, `runtime-adapter`

Canonical roots are:

```txt
packages/foundation/<kind>/<name>
packages/drivers/<name>
packages/tooling/<kind>/<name>
agents/<kind>/<name>
```

Code packages record `family` and `kind` in `package.json` under a top-level
`beep` object when that family intentionally declares a kind segment.
`drivers` record `family` only. Agent bundles record the same metadata in
`beep.json`.

Rationale:

Family-only taxonomy is too vague for families that use a kind segment. Family
plus kind makes dependency rules, file-role conventions, and browsing
expectations visible from the path and machine-readable in metadata, while
`drivers` remains the explicit flat-family exception.

## 2026-04-23: Allow `shared/use-cases` As A High-Bar Shared-Kernel Exception

- **Status:** Active

Decision:

`shared/use-cases` is canonical only as a high-bar shared-kernel exception. It
is contract-only:

- cross-slice commands and queries
- driver-neutral DTOs and boundary/protocol contracts
- client-safe application errors and facade interfaces
- product ports

It does not own workflows, process managers, schedulers, handlers, concrete
adapters, driver imports, or live Layer values.

Rationale:

Some cross-slice application language deserves a durable shared home, but
shared must stay small and must not become a runtime/orchestration bucket.

## 2026-04-23: Make Boundary-Sensitive Export Subpaths Canonical

- **Status:** Active
- **Supersedes:** [2026-04-21: Restrict Client-Safe Use-Case Imports](#2026-04-21-restrict-client-safe-use-case-imports)

Decision:

Boundary-sensitive packages publish explicit canonical subpaths:

- `use-cases`: `/public`, `/server`, `/test`
- `config`: `/public`, `/server`, `/secrets`, `/layer`, `/test`
- browser-safe driver surfaces: `@beep/<driver>/browser`

For `use-cases`, `/public` is the client-safe application contract surface and
`/server` is the server-only application contract surface. The shared-kernel
`shared/use-cases` exception uses the same names but remains narrower than slice
`use-cases`.

Canonical subpath names are required names when that role exists, not a requirement
to publish placeholder exports. Package roots and `./*` wildcard exports may
remain during migration, but they are transitional only.

Rationale:

Explicit subpaths make browser/server safety visible in imports and let the
target doctrine coexist with migration-era root exports.

## 2026-04-23: Keep Live Application Layer Composition Out Of `use-cases`

- **Status:** Active

Decision:

`use-cases` and `shared/use-cases` never export live Layer values. `drivers`
may export boundary-local layer constructors. `config` may expose
server/runtime-only config resolution helpers under `/layer`. `server` and
`client` own package-local application Layer composition, and top-level
application entrypoints compose those package-local boundaries.

Rationale:

This keeps use-cases as application contract language while leaving live wiring
at adapter boundaries where runtime dependencies belong.

Supersedes older wording that described `use-cases/server` as a runtime-complete
surface. Live Layer composition remains package-local to `server` and `client`,
with top-level application entrypoints composing those boundaries.

## 2026-04-23: Use Semantic Foundation Names And Repo-Scoped Tooling Names

- **Status:** Active

Decision:

Foundation packages use semantic public names such as `@beep/schema`,
`@beep/identity`, and `@beep/ui`. Driver packages use short capability names
such as `@beep/drizzle` and `@beep/postgres`. Tooling packages use repo-scoped
public names such as `@beep/repo-cli` and `@beep/repo-configs`.

Rationale:

Foundation packages are reusable substrate and should read cleanly in imports.
Tooling packages are repo-operational by design and should advertise that role
in their names.

## 2026-04-23: Keep Agent Content Portable And Runtime Wiring Declarative

- **Status:** Superseded
- **Superseded by:** [2026-05-01: Retire Assistant Bundles From Architecture](#2026-05-01-retire-assistant-bundles-from-architecture)

Decision:

Agent architecture separates portable content from runtime wiring.

- `skill-pack` owns portable guidance bundles
- `policy-pack` owns declarative steering packets
- `runtime-adapter` composes skill/policy packs declaratively for a concrete
  runtime

Runtime adapters may contain config, templates, and mappings, but executable
logic lives in `tooling/tool`, not in `agents`.

Rationale:

Portable content should not fork per runtime. Declarative runtime adapters keep
Claude, Codex, and future runtime-specific wiring visible without duplicating
the content itself.

## 2026-04-23: Ban Script-Only Pseudo-Packages As A Canonical Pattern

- **Status:** Active

Decision:

Script-only pseudo-packages are not a canonical architecture style. Repo-wide
task aggregation belongs at the root or inside a real `tooling/tool` package
with explicit topology and entrypoints.

Rationale:

If a package matters enough to be named in the architecture, it should have a
real role contract that readers can infer from structure instead of a
single `package.json` full of scripts.

## 2026-04-27: Split Postgres And Drizzle Drivers From Product Repositories

- **Status:** Active

Decision:

Production database capability is composed from specific driver packages, not a
generic shared-server database bucket:

- `packages/drivers/postgres` publishes `@beep/postgres` with
  `PostgresClient.makeLayer`, `PostgresError`, SQLSTATE diagnostics, SQL
  formatting, Drizzle Effect Postgres composition, and migrations;
- `packages/drivers/drizzle` publishes `@beep/drizzle` with
  `Drizzle.makeLayer` and `DrizzleError`.
- The old placeholder `@beep/pglite` driver package is deleted. PGLite remains
  only as a test-harness implementation in `@beep/test-utils`, not as a
  first-class production driver package.

`@beep/drizzle` exposes its root driver API directly, for example
`import { Drizzle, DrizzleError } from "@beep/drizzle"`. `DrizzleError` is the
only public Drizzle driver error. It is technical and operation-scoped, carrying
`operation`, optional `cause`, and optional query context when native Drizzle
errors expose it. The drifted `DrizzleProviderError`, `ProviderError`,
`ORMError`, and `QueryError` surfaces are rejected.

`PostgresError` follows the same technical, operation-scoped rule and may
include SQLSTATE, constraint, source-location, and formatted-query diagnostics
when known. Those diagnostics support logging and translation; they are not
product application errors.

`Drizzle.makeLayer(client)` accepts a narrow product-neutral Drizzle adapter.
Runtime composition decides whether that adapter is backed by Postgres or some
other database runtime. Transaction APIs use explicit Effect-native
`withTransaction` callbacks and do not use ambient transaction context.

Server-side product repositories translate driver errors into product-named
repository or application errors. Use-case ports never expose Drizzle or
Postgres driver errors directly.

The following legacy/shared abstractions are rejected for this architecture
slice:

- `Db.make`
- `DbClient.make`
- shared-domain `DatabaseError`
- shared-server `DbRepo.make`
- `@beep/pglite` as a production driver package
- `DrizzleProviderError`
- `ProviderError`
- `ORMError`
- `QueryError`

`DbRepo.make` is not ported. A successor is deferred until at least two real
repositories prove repeated boilerplate. Prefer a tooling generator or template
over a runtime factory unless live code proves that a runtime helper is simpler.

PGLite-specific tooling may stay in the test utility harness while it remains
useful for integration tests. That test harness does not imply a production
`@beep/pglite` package or a second database-driver doctrine.

Rationale:

The architecture already treats drivers as repo-level technical capability and
server packages as product adapter owners. A generic `Db` facade would blur that
boundary and make shared/server look like an infrastructure runtime. Specific
driver names keep imports honest, make error translation explicit, and let the
first real repositories drive any helper extraction with evidence.

## 2026-04-27: Keep Shared Entity Metadata In The Shared Kernel

- **Status:** Active

Decision:

The product-facing shared entity vocabulary (`BaseEntity`, `EntityId`,
`EntityRef`, `Principal`, and source-kind vocabulary) remains in
`@beep/shared-domain` while it encodes shared product semantics: tenant
organization scoping, actor provenance, source facets, schema versioning, and
row versioning.

The generic persistence kernel belongs in `@beep/schema/EntitySchema`.
Persisted entities are schema classes whose decoded side is domain language and
whose encoded side is the persistence row shape. Entity-specific `.model.ts`
files inline rich `fields` and storage-neutral `persisted` descriptors together
so the domain shape, encoded shape, and persistence metadata drift at compile
time instead of through parallel mapping files.

`BaseEntity.Class` is the approved shared product class factory for invariant
entity fields. It composes shared product invariants into concrete entity
schemas, but it does not own the generic SQL projection.

`@beep/drizzle` `EntityTable.pgTableFrom` is the approved generic table
projection for schema-first entity classes. Shared table packages may use it to
publish metadata-only Drizzle table definitions for shared product tables, but
they do not own live database execution, transactions, repository helpers,
migrations, seeders, or driver runtime capability.

The old `EntityMixin` and `@beep/shared-tables/table/Table.make` APIs are
retired and should be deleted/replaced instead of migrated forward.

Rationale:

The Organization proof needs one deliberately shared entity concept whose
`orgId` tenant field, actor fields, entity-id metadata, schema metadata, and
table metadata stay consistent across shared-domain, shared-tables, and shared
UI. Splitting the generic kernel into foundation modeling and the Drizzle
projection into the driver package keeps product language pure while avoiding a
parallel domain-to-table mapping layer.

## 2026-05-01: Add Enforcement Lanes And Rough-Edge Refinements

- **Status:** Active

Decision:

The architecture standard now classifies high-risk rules with four enforcement
lanes:

- `Doctrine`
- `Generated Default`
- `Review Gate`
- `Hard Check`

This is a docs-only refinement. It does not implement generators, lint rules,
import-boundary checks, package metadata checks, or code migrations.

The refinement also locks the following doctrine:

- `foundation/capability` remains canonical but must pass specific-home-first
  routing plus a negative gate and proof.
- Meaningful high-bar `shared/*` exports require promotion records in the
  affected package README.
- `shared/use-cases` remains strict contract-only and does not own workflows,
  process managers, schedulers, handlers, concrete adapters, driver imports, or
  live Layers.
- New slices grow by incremental spine. New packages require a concrete role
  plus meaningful exported behavior, contract, adapter, config surface, or test
  fixture.
- App-level Layer composition may use app-local helpers such as
  `apps/<app>/src/runtime/Layer.ts`, but only for composition over public
  slice/package boundaries.
- The God Layer rejection test is Boundary + Ownership: app/runtime composition
  must not reach into private slice internals or own cross-slice policy,
  handlers, repositories, schedules, workflows, or orchestration.
- Migration language uses five buckets: `Target Doctrine`, `Transitional
  Compatibility`, `Cleanup-On-Touch`, `Forbidden In New Work`, and `Pending
  Automation/Generator Support`.
- Browser capability routing is platform-first: browser platform wrappers go to
  drivers with explicit `/browser` entrypoints, product-agnostic React
  ergonomics go to `foundation/ui-system`, and product-specific behavior stays
  in slice `client` or `ui`.

Rationale:

The architecture had strong direction but several social constraints were too
soft: "high bar", "avoid God Layers", target-first migration, and
`foundation/capability` all needed operational tests. The refinement preserves
the target doctrine while naming what belongs in future generators, future hard
checks, and present-day review gates.

## 2026-05-01: Lock Strict Action Errors And Fixture-First Proof

- **Status:** Active

Decision:

The architecture now treats public use-case errors as action-level failures
only. Driver/internal failures die in adapters, port failures die in use-case
orchestration, and public action failures die in protocol handlers. Port errors
may be declared in use-case packages, but they are server-only and do not cross
the public use-case API.

The executable proof target is `packages/architecture-lab/*` with
`apps/architecture-lab-proof`. It must remain the first place we prove boundary
subpaths, package shape, and port-to-action error translation before broad repo
automation or generator work expands the pattern.

The refinement also locks:

- `shared/use-cases` product ports are ultra-high-bar exceptions, even inside
  the high-bar shared-use-cases exception.
- Scratchpad and explicitly temporary `_internal` package experiments are valid
  learning lanes, but product packages must not import them and promotion must
  re-enter through the smallest legal slice shape.
- Protocol spans may be request trace roots; use-case spans are architectural
  roots inside them. Observability attributes must stay bounded and avoid PII,
  secrets, raw input, and large payloads.

Rationale:

The previous doctrine had the right direction, but "application errors" and
"port errors" were too easy to blur. A strict action-error boundary makes
client, handler, and use-case signatures easier to reason about and gives tests
one precise thing to prove. Keeping the proof fixture-first avoids turning
architecture prose into a wish list.

## 2026-05-01: Retire Assistant Bundles From Architecture

- **Status:** Active
- **Supersedes:**
  - [2026-04-23: Add Explicit Non-Slice Artifact Families](#2026-04-23-add-explicit-non-slice-artifact-families)
  - [2026-04-23: Give Every Non-Slice Artifact A Family And, When Applicable, A Kind](#2026-04-23-give-every-non-slice-artifact-a-family-and-when-applicable-a-kind)
  - [2026-04-23: Keep Agent Content Portable And Runtime Wiring Declarative](#2026-04-23-keep-agent-content-portable-and-runtime-wiring-declarative)

Decision:

Assistant runtime configuration is no longer an architecture family, package
family, or topology taxonomy in this repo. The canonical non-slice families are
now only:

- `foundation` for domain-agnostic reusable substrate
- `drivers` for flat repo-level external boundary wrappers
- `tooling` for developer-operational code packages

Runtime-specific assistant files may exist only as normal harness-native
configuration, such as Claude project settings or skills. They are not
workspace packages, do not carry `beep` family/kind metadata, and are not part
of the package dependency model.

Rationale:

Claude, Codex, and similar harnesses are changing faster than this repo should
architect around. Treating their project configuration as first-class repo
architecture created extra maintenance without improving product boundaries.
The architecture should describe durable code ownership; harness configuration
should stay minimal, runtime-native, and easy to delete.

## 2026-05-12: Supersede Fixture-Lab With Architecture-Lab WorkItem Proof

- **Status:** Active
- **Supersedes:**
  - [2026-05-01: Lock Strict Action Errors And Fixture-First Proof](#2026-05-01-lock-strict-action-errors-and-fixture-first-proof)
    only for the executable proof target.

Decision:

The canonical executable proof target is now the normal
`packages/architecture-lab/*` slice family with the `apps/architecture-lab-proof`
contract harness. `WorkItem` is the full aggregate proof at
`aggregates/WorkItem`, `Worker` is the persisted entity archetype at
`entities/Worker`, and `WorkPriority` is the domain-only value archetype at
`values/WorkPriority`.

The old `fixture-lab/Specimen` proof and repo-architecture-automation fixture
are retired as active topology. Retained lessons live in
`goals/canonical-slice-factory/history/repo-architecture-automation-reference.md`;
the deleted package and fixture files are available only through git history.

The strict action-error doctrine from 2026-05-01 remains active: driver/internal
failures die in adapters, port failures die in use-case orchestration, and
public action failures die in protocol handlers. The new proof target exists to
make that doctrine reproducible through the `beep architecture` operation-plan
factory instead of a drifted fixture.

Rationale:

`fixture-lab/Specimen` no longer matched the normal slice topology the repo
wants agents and generators to copy. A boring lifecycle aggregate inside a real
slice family gives the factory a better oracle: domain, use-cases, config,
server, tables, client, UI, app harness, and db-admin migration proof can all be
checked as staged architecture parts.

## 2026-05-09: Model Finite Cases As Discriminated Unions

- **Status:** Active

Decision:

Finite data cases are architecture-visible domain modeling, not incidental
object optionality. When a shape represents variants, lifecycle states,
status/result cases, or case-specific payloads, model it as a discriminated
union. Effect Schema models should use tagged unions: `S.toTaggedUnion("<field>")`
for normal discriminators such as `kind`, `type`, `status`, `profile`, or
`family`, and `S.TaggedUnion(...)` only for canonical `_tag` unions.

External wire contracts may still arrive as optional/nullish bags when
compatibility requires that shape. Those bags must be decoded or normalized at
the boundary into an internal tagged model before domain, use-case, driver, or
client behavior branches on the case.

This is doctrine and review guidance in the first initiative. It does not add a
hard scanner, generated-schema migration, or broad repository sweep.

Rationale:

Optional/nullish bags hide invariants: they let impossible payload
combinations typecheck, make lifecycle transitions harder to audit, and push
case semantics into scattered branches. Tagged models make the finite set of
cases executable, branchable, decodable, and documentable from one schema. The
architecture already treats schemas as executable contracts; finite cases need
the same runtime evidence as ordinary object fields.

## 2026-05-20: Stack Installer Pre-v1 Slice

- **Status:** Retired 2026-06-15

Decision:

Stack Installer used one installer slice before v1. That slice and app have
since been removed from the live workspace before any compatibility contract
was published.

The earlier category topology for `installer-dependencies`,
`installer-security`, `installer-providers`, `installer-channels`, and
`installer-workspace` is retired as target topology. Those names may remain in
historical initiative outputs as evidence of the earlier P1 state, but they are
not compatibility packages, sunset aliases, or desired v1 boundaries.

Waiver:

Because the correction happens before v1 compatibility exists, all known
consumers migrate in the same PR. No compatibility wrappers, re-export
packages, or sunset aliases are required. A dedicated installer config package
is deferred until real installer configuration exists; the current Bun version
contract remains installer-owned without creating a premature config package.

Rationale:

The category names describe installer concepts, but they do not yet have
independent product lifecycles. Splitting them into sibling slices before v1
adds package coordination and migration surface without proving separate
bounded contexts. One installer slice keeps the domain/use-case/server boundary
strict while letting the future promote a category only when it earns a
separate lifecycle.

## 2026-05-22: Canonize Namespace-First `@beep/schema` Concept Modules

- **Status:** Active

Decision:

`@beep/schema` uses namespace-first concept modules as the canonical topology
for reusable schema concepts. Public concept subpaths are flat, for example
`@beep/schema/Duration`, `@beep/schema/Glob`, `@beep/schema/Color`, and
`@beep/schema/HttpStatus`. Consumers import those modules as namespaces and use
concise role members such as `Schema`, `Input`, `FromInput`, `Object`, and
`Unit`.

The package root remains a curated flat facade for convenience and migration
compatibility. It is not the canonical namespace surface. Concept role files
live under `packages/foundation/modeling/schema/src/<Concept>/` and are source
topology only; public consumers import the concept index. Utility namespaces
such as `SchemaUtils` may expose helper leaves when the helper is itself the
public concept.

Former topical suites are represented by leaf concept modules, not broad suite
aggregators. Import `@beep/schema/EvmAddress`, `@beep/schema/DomReactNode`, or
`@beep/schema/HttpStatus` directly instead of importing retired aggregators
such as `@beep/schema/Blockchain`, `@beep/schema/Dom`, or
`@beep/schema/Http`. Promote source concepts rather than every exported symbol;
for example, `HttpStatus` remains one concept module rather than a public
subpath per status literal.

Migration is compatibility-first. Legacy root exports, full repeated names such
as `DurationInput`, and existing nested paths may remain while consumers move
to canonical flat concept modules. Broad `./*` wildcard export reliance should
be retired only after explicit canonical and compatibility subpaths exist.

Rationale:

Effect-style module consistency is valuable because it lets reusable modules
share names like `map`, `Schema`, `Input`, or `FromInput` without forcing global
symbol uniqueness. The repo should keep that consistency without adopting very
large source files. Small role files under concept folders preserve the
architecture's context-compression benefits for coding agents and reviewers,
especially because `@beep/schema` carries heavy documentation.

## 2026-05-22: Close `@beep/schema` Topology Compatibility

- **Status:** Active

Decision:

The `@beep/schema` topology migration is closed around PascalCase exact concept
modules. Lowercase topical source directories and public subpaths are retired:
do not restore paths such as `src/color/`, `src/http/`,
`@beep/schema/color`, or `@beep/schema/http/headers`. Public package exports for
schema concepts point at concept indexes only; role files under
`src/<Concept>/` are private source topology. Legacy acronym casing subpaths
such as `@beep/schema/ExpectCT` and `@beep/schema/XSSProtection` are retired in
favor of canonical concept casing (`ExpectCt`, `XssProtection`).

The package root remains a curated flat facade for common helpers and migration
aliases. Purposeful repeated names may remain inside canonical concept modules
when they keep current consumers clear during migration, such as
`Duration.DurationInput` beside `Duration.Input`. The broad package wildcard and
lowercase topical compatibility paths are not compatibility surfaces.

The repo enforces this closure with `bun run beep lint schema-topology`, which
checks `@beep/schema` source directories, package exports, public role-file
targets, retired casing aliases, and root `tsconfig` alias drift.

Rationale:

The compatibility-first phase let the repo introduce canonical modules without
blocking downstream consumers. Once the package exposed exact PascalCase concept
subpaths and tests/dtslint covered role-file privacy, keeping lowercase suite
paths became pure topology debt. Removing them makes `ls src` match the public
mental model, prevents case-only ambiguity, and gives agents a much smaller
navigation surface.

## 2026-06-18: Cross-Slice Consumption Of The Epistemic Boundary

- **Status:** Active

Decision:

A reusable, product-agnostic boundary realized as a slice — e.g. `epistemic`
(domain entities + use-case services + a live SHACL Layer) — stays a slice. It
cannot move wholesale to `shared/*` (no live Layers anywhere in the family;
`shared/use-cases` is contract-only) or `foundation/capability` (no domain-entity
ownership). A consuming vertical (e.g.
`law-practice`) crosses the boundary by tier:

- **Substrate** — domain-agnostic value shapes such as a char-offset anchor or a
  unit interval — is promoted to `foundation/modeling` (`@beep/provenance`
  `TextAnchor`, `@beep/schema` `UnitInterval`). Any slice's `domain` may import
  it directly.
- **Product-language vocabulary** that a second vertical types against — the
  `ClaimLifecycle` admission states — is promoted to `shared/domain` with a
  promotion record. Promote the minimum, not the whole model.
- **Mechanism** — the gate, projection, and transition services and their live
  Layers — stays in the owning slice. The consuming slice composes it at the
  use-cases/server tier via a documented **bounded exception** recorded in the
  consumer packet's Exception Ledger, until a third consumer justifies extracting
  a `shared/use-cases` contract (or emitted event) per
  `01-hexagonal-vertical-slices.md:71-74`.

Rationale:

This is the architecture's predicted "first contact" with cross-slice boundaries
(see Known Unknowns). The absolute rule — a slice `domain` imports only
shared-kernel plus `foundation/primitive|modeling`
(`01-hexagonal-vertical-slices.md:60-61`) — is honored with zero exceptions by
routing substrate to foundation and shared vocabulary to shared-kernel. The
softer cross-slice integration rule (`:71-74`) is bent only at the
use-cases/server composition tier, transparently and with a removal trigger,
rather than building a full shared contract for a single-fixture spike. This
keeps the just-shipped `epistemic` slice a slice while making `law-practice`
doctrine-clean at the domain tier, and gives every future vertical that consumes
a slice-shaped boundary a worked routing precedent.

## 2026-06-21: Remove Placeholder Shared-Kernel Packages

- **Status:** Active
- **Refines:** [2026-04-23: Allow `shared/use-cases` As A High-Bar Shared-Kernel Exception](#2026-04-23-allow-shareduse-cases-as-a-high-bar-shared-kernel-exception)

Decision:

Placeholder shared-kernel package directories are removed. The current
`packages/shared` inventory is only the packages with real surfaces:
`shared/domain` and `shared/tables`. `shared/config`, `shared/use-cases`,
`shared/client`, `shared/server`, and `shared/ui` remain reserved role names, not
package directories. `shared/use-cases` in particular does not exist yet because
no contract-only cross-slice surface has met the promotion bar.

Rationale:

Empty or nearly empty packages make the architecture look heavier than the code
really is. Keeping role names in the doctrine is useful; keeping placeholder
workspace packages is not. A future promotion PR can recreate the exact package
it needs, with a package README promotion record, generated identity composer,
workspace registration, tsconfig reference, and boundary provenance in the same
change.

## Known Unknowns

Areas the doctrine does not yet cover and which the authors expect to revise as the architecture is load-tested:

- **Testing strategy.** Doc `08-testing.md` codifies slice-isolation testing, port stubs via `Layer.mock`, fixture ownership, and contract tests between use-cases and server adapters. The doctrine has not yet been load-tested against a real refactor; first contact with a non-trivial slice may surface gaps in the fixture-ownership and contract-test rules.
- **Cross-slice coordination.** Doc `10-cross-slice-coordination.md` codifies workflow / saga / process-manager governance, future event contracts in `shared/use-cases`, and the God Process Manager anti-pattern. The open question is how the rules hold up the first time a real workflow needs to span three or more slices with partial-failure semantics.
- **Evolution and deprecation.** Doc `11-evolution-and-deprecation.md` codifies slice retirement, future `shared/use-cases` versioning, port deprecation, and feature-flag lifetime. The deprecation-window durations and the five-step retirement procedure are unproven; the first real slice retirement will tell us whether the windows are realistic and whether the DECISIONS-entry requirement creates useful pressure or just paperwork.
- **Observability conventions.** Doc `12-observability.md` codifies span naming, attribute conventions, the logging-vs-tracing-vs-Console split, and slice boundaries as span boundaries. The open question is whether the span/attribute namespacing survives contact with a real distributed trace across three or more slices, and whether the conventions need adjustment once a tracer backend is wired up end-to-end.
- **Error translation across boundaries.** Doc `09-errors-across-boundaries.md` codifies who translates, where translation lives, and the canonical translator function shape. The fixture proves port-to-action translation; the doctrine has not yet been exercised against a real driver-to-port adapter path. The first non-trivial adapter will tell us whether the translator placement rules are precise enough or need a worked example per boundary kind.
- **Promotion record enforcement.** Records are required by doctrine; lint enforcement (`lint:promotion-records`) is planned but not yet implemented.

Pull requests revising these areas should append entries here documenting the decision and removing the corresponding "planned" line.
