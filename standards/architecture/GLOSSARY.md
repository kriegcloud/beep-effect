# Architecture Glossary

This glossary defines the vocabulary used by
[`standards/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md). Use these terms consistently
in code review, docs, architecture notes, and future enforcement work.

## Aggregate

A consistency boundary with an aggregate root. Use `aggregates/` when lifecycle,
invariants, or transitions span multiple child entities or values.

## Artifact Family

The top-level architecture class for a non-slice artifact. The canonical
non-slice families are `foundation`, `drivers`, and `tooling`.

## Artifact Kind

The canonical role inside an artifact family. Every non-slice artifact belongs
to exactly one family. Kinds remain required for families that intentionally
declare a kind segment, such as `foundation` and `tooling`; `drivers` is the
flat-family exception.

## Adapter

Code that connects product language to an external protocol, runtime, library,
or infrastructure capability. Server HTTP handlers, RPC handlers, repository
implementations, projections, and client command/query clients are adapters.

## Actionable Error

A typed failure that callers can branch on to drive product behavior. Access
denied, conflict, stale version, not found, invalid transition, and idempotency
violation are actionable. Driver connection failures are usually internal
until translated.

## Action Error

A public use-case failure exported from a use-case package's `/public` subpath.
Protocol handlers, clients, and UI code may branch on action errors. Port,
driver, and domain failures must be translated before they become action
errors.

## Anemic Domain Model

A domain model that only describes data shape and maybe validation. An anemic
model does not own meaningful behavior.

## App Layer Helper

An app-local Layer composition module, usually
`apps/<app>/src/runtime/Layer.ts`, that composes public slice/package Layers for
one application. It is not a monorepo package family and must not own product
policy, handlers, repositories, schedules, workflows, or cross-slice
orchestration.

## Client Package

The slice package that owns browser/client adapters, remote command/query
clients, client services, atoms, form models, and client state machines.

## Client-Safe Use-Case Export

A use-case export that may be imported by client packages without dragging
server-only orchestration or infrastructure into the browser. Command/query
language, driver-neutral boundary contracts, driver-neutral DTOs, actionable
application errors, and client-safe facade interfaces are usually client-safe. Those
exports must be re-exported from a client-safe subpath such as
`@beep/<slice>-use-cases/public`. Product ports, server-only service/facade
contracts, workflows, process managers, schedulers, and live Layer values are
not client-safe.

## Concept

A named domain idea such as `Membership`, `Account`, `Enrollment`, or
`Invitation`. Concepts are mirrored across packages by folder path and
distinguished by role suffix.

## Concept-Qualified Role Module Naming

The naming convention:

```txt
<package>/src/<domain-kind>/<Concept>/<Concept>.<role>.ts
```

Examples:

```txt
Membership.policy.ts
Membership.commands.ts
Membership.event-handlers.ts
Membership.command-client.ts
```

## Config Contract

A typed application/runtime configuration contract expressed with Effect
`Config`, schemas, config services, and live/test Layers. A config contract may
be backed by environment variables, files, secret stores, static test fixtures,
or application entrypoint composition.

## Config Package

The slice package that owns typed config contracts for a slice:
`@beep/<slice>-config`. It may define public config, server config, redacted
secret config, config services, config vocabulary, and server/runtime-only
config resolution helpers that read from the ambient `ConfigProvider`. Config
packages publish those boundaries through canonical subpath names such as `/public`,
`/server`, `/secrets`, `/layer`, and `/test`. `/public` is the only
browser-safe config surface. Canonical subpath names are required names when that
role exists, not a placeholder-export requirement. Package roots and `./*`
exports may remain during migration, but they are transitional rather than the
canonical boundary contract. A config package is optional canonical-shape, and it
is not a broad constants package.

## Cleanup-On-Touch

A migration bucket for legacy or transitional shapes that do not require an
immediate sweep, but must be corrected when their boundary is edited. The
cleanup scope is the touched boundary, not the whole package family.

## Domain-Kind Folder

A folder that classifies the kind of domain concept. The canonical domain-kind
folders are `aggregates/`, `entities/`, and `values/`. `policies/` and
`services/` are escape hatches.

## Domain Package

The driver-neutral package that owns rich models, values, aggregates,
contracts, domain events, pure policies, access vocabulary, and pure lifecycle
state machines.

## Driver

A technical capability package under `packages/drivers/<name>`. Drivers wrap
third-party or infrastructure concerns such as Drizzle, Postgres, SQLite,
EventLog, workflow engines, queues, sharding, transactions, retries, browser
APIs, and driver-local configuration. Driver packages use short public names
such as `@beep/drizzle`. When a driver exposes browser-safe functionality, it
must do so from `@beep/<driver>/browser`; the package root is not browser-safe
by default.

## Drivers Family

The non-slice family for flat repo-level external boundary wrappers. Drivers may
depend on `foundation` and other drivers when acyclic, but they do not depend on
product slices or the shared kernel.

## Foundation Family

The non-slice family for domain-agnostic reusable substrate. Canonical kinds
are `primitive`, `modeling`, `capability`, and `ui-system`. Foundation packages
do not depend on product slices or the shared kernel.

## Entity

An identity-bearing concept. Use `entities/` for identity-bearing concepts that
are not aggregate roots, or simple concepts whose consistency boundary is only
themselves.

## Enforcement Lane

The way an architecture rule becomes real. Canonical lanes are `Doctrine`,
`Generated Default`, `Review Gate`, and `Hard Check`.

## Foundation Capability

A `foundation/capability` package: repo-owned, domain-agnostic technical
substrate that does not carry product semantics, does not wrap an external
engine or browser platform API, is not tooling, and is not UI-system ergonomics.
It needs multiple real consumers or explicit platform-capability rationale.

## God Layer

A central runtime Layer that merges many unrelated slices and drivers into one
global dependency graph. God Layers hide ownership, create cross-slice coupling,
and make experiments expensive to remove.

## Generated Default

An enforcement lane for architecture rules that future generators or scaffolds
should make the default. A generated default is still downstream from the
architecture standard; it does not make the standard a generator design.

## Hard Check

An enforcement lane for rules that should be mechanically enforced by lint,
package metadata, import-boundary checks, fixture checks, repo-cli commands, or
similar automation.

## Hexagonal Vertical Slice

A slice that combines vertical product modularity with hexagonal boundaries.
Domain and use-cases sit inside every slice. Config sits inside the slice when
meaningful config contracts exist. Server, client, tables, and UI are adapters
around that core, while repo-level drivers stay outside the slice as shared
technical boundaries.

## Internal Error

A technical failure that should be logged, traced, retried, or translated at a
boundary, but should not directly drive product behavior in domain/use-case
code.

## Modeling Package

A `foundation` kind for reusable schemas, brands, identity contracts, and
modeling vocabulary that higher-level foundation packages and slices may reuse
without taking product-domain dependencies.

## Provenance Anchor

A domain-agnostic value that pins derived knowledge to where it came from in a
source. The canonical shape is `TextAnchor` (`@beep/provenance`): a half-open
character range `[startChar, endChar)` into a source document plus the exact
quoted substring, re-sliceable as `text.slice(startChar, endChar)`. It is pure
provenance substrate — no confidence, claim, or domain semantics — and lives in
`foundation/modeling` so any slice's `domain` can ground knowledge in a source
span without depending on another slice. Consuming slices wrap it (e.g.
epistemic `EvidenceSpan` = `TextAnchor` fields + a `Confidence`).

## Schema Concept Module

A flat public `@beep/schema/<Concept>` module that owns one reusable
domain-agnostic schema concept or concept family. Consumers import it as a
namespace and use role members such as `Schema`, `Input`, or `FromInput`.
Concept modules use PascalCase exact subpaths; retired lowercase topical
subpaths such as `@beep/schema/color` are not compatibility surfaces.

## Schema Flat Facade

The curated `@beep/schema` package root. It re-exports common schema helpers and
legacy flat names for convenience and compatibility, but it is not the canonical
home for full schema concept namespaces or retired topical paths.

## Schema Role File

A source file under `packages/foundation/modeling/schema/src/<Concept>/` whose
suffix names its responsibility, such as `.schema.ts`, `.input.ts`, or
`.transforms.ts`. Schema role files are source topology; public consumers import
the concept index. Package exports must point at concept indexes, not role
files.

## Schema Utility Namespace

A utility-oriented `@beep/schema` namespace whose public concept is a helper or
combinator rather than a reusable data schema. `SchemaUtils` may expose helper
leaves such as `@beep/schema/SchemaUtils/pluck` when direct helper imports are
the intended API.

## Port

A product-language capability required by use-cases. Ports live in
`use-cases` by default and are implemented by adapters, usually in `server`.

## Port Error

A server-only failure declared by a use-case port and exported from the use-case
package's `/server` subpath. Adapters translate driver/internal failures into
port errors; use-case services translate port errors into public action errors.

## Private (in app-layer composition)

Anything not exported through a canonical subpath (`/public`, `/server`, `/secrets`, `/layer`, `/test`) of a package's public root. App-level composition (e.g., `apps/<app>/src/runtime/Layer.ts`) may import only from canonical subpaths; reaching past them into a package's internal module structure is the boundary violation. The same rule applies to any consumer outside the owning package: only canonical subpaths are public.

## Product Port Implementation

A server-side implementation of a use-case port. Example:
`server/src/entities/Membership/Membership.repo.ts` implements
`MembershipRepository` using tables and drivers.

## Promotion Record

A package README entry that proves a high-bar shared export earned its home. It
records shared product semantics, consumers or cross-slice rationale, exported
surface, rejected homes, runtime/driver/Layer limits, and review evidence.

## Canonical Subpath Name

A canonical export name for a boundary-sensitive package role. Required means
use this subpath name when the role exists; it does not require placeholder
exports from packages that do not need that role.

## Policy Pack

A declarative policy/configuration bundle. In `tooling`, policy packs publish
shared governance data or config presets. Policy packs are not executable
applications.

## Public Config

Browser-safe config contracts and services exported from a config package. Client
packages may import public config; they must not import server config or secret
config.

## Protocol Declaration

A driver-neutral boundary contract such as an HttpApi endpoint group, Rpc
group, AI tool contract, or cluster entity protocol. Protocol declarations live
in `use-cases`; handlers, clients, transports, runtimes, persistence, and
driver access do not.

## Projection

A server-side writer that consumes events or write-model changes and updates a
read model. Projection code belongs in `server`; read-model table declarations
belong in `tables`.

## Read Model

A persistence shape optimized for queries, UI, reporting, or projections. Read
model tables use `.read-model-table.ts` and are composed by `ReadModels.ts`.

## Rich Domain Model

A domain model that owns shape, validation, and pure behavior. Rich behavior may
be instance methods, exported pure functions, `*.behavior.ts`, or pure
`*.policy.ts` modules.

## Review Gate

An enforcement lane for contextual or exception-based rules that need explicit
review evidence instead of purely mechanical checking.

## Schema-First Model

A pure data model whose `Schema` value is the source of truth. TypeScript types,
constructors, decoders, encoders, guards, equivalence, defaults, validation
messages, and documentation metadata derive from that schema instead of living
beside it as parallel definitions.

## Role Suffix

The filename suffix that states a module's role. Examples include `.model.ts`,
`.policy.ts`, `.ports.ts`, `.http-handlers.ts`, `.projections.ts`, and
`.config.ts`.

## Secret Config

Server-only secret configuration represented with redacted values. Secret config
must live behind explicit secret/server-only modules and must not be exported
through `/public` or any other browser-safe surface.

## Server Config

Server-only config contracts and services exported from a config package. Server
config may include runtime settings that are not safe or meaningful in browser
bundles.

## Shared Kernel

The DDD meaning of the `shared` package family: deliberately shared
cross-cutting language, value objects, schemas, config contracts, and a small
number of high-bar cross-slice adapters. `shared/domain` is the active normal
home today; `shared/config` is a reserved normal role. `shared/use-cases`,
`shared/client`, `shared/server`, and `shared/ui` are reserved high-bar roles,
not package directories today. `shared/tables` exists but remains exceptional.
A future `shared/use-cases` package is contract-only: it may hold cross-slice
commands, queries, driver-neutral DTOs, driver-neutral boundary contracts,
client-safe application errors, facade interfaces, and ultra-high-bar product
ports, but not workflows, process managers, schedulers, handlers, concrete
adapters, driver imports, or live Layers.
Shared packages consume shared-kernel language from shared and may consume
appropriate `foundation` packages beside it; they do not own drivers. Shared
is not a synonym for `common` or `foundation`, and it is not a place for
miscellaneous leftovers from product slices.

**Terminology caveat:** strict DDD uses "shared kernel" for code shared across team boundaries with explicit cross-team coordination. In this monorepo the term is used for *deliberate cross-slice product language within a single team's codebase* — closer to a "published language for an internal context." The connotations of high coordination cost still apply (every promotion record is a small coordination act), but the cross-team framing does not. The term is kept because it does the work of distinguishing "deliberate cross-slice" from "junk drawer."

## Slice

A bounded product/domain package family such as `iam`. A slice owns its domain,
use-cases, config contracts when present, server adapters, client adapters,
tables, and UI. Drivers stay repo-level instead of being slice package kinds.

## Scratchpad Lane

A temporary experiment home under `scratchpad/` or explicitly temporary
`packages/_internal/*` packages. Scratchpad code may prove an idea, but product
slices and public package exports must not import it. Promotion re-enters
through the smallest legal slice shape.

## Tables Package

The slice package that owns product-specific persistence schema and mapping.
Tables are the slice-local persistence adapter surface for product schema and
mappings. They are not domain and they are not generic driver wrappers.

## Tooling Package

A code-bearing package in the `tooling` family. Canonical kinds are `library`,
`tool`, `policy-pack`, and `test-kit`. Tooling packages support development and
operations; product/runtime code does not depend on them.

## Use-Case Package

The slice package that owns application intent: commands, queries,
driver-neutral boundary/protocol contracts, authorization, ports,
service/facade contracts, slice-local workflow/process/scheduler contracts, and
public action errors. Canonical export surfaces are `/public`,
`/server`, and `/test`.
`/public` is client-safe application contract surface. `/server` is server-only
application contract surface. Package roots and `./*` exports may remain during
migration, but they are transitional rather than the canonical boundary
contract.

## Value Object

A concept with no identity. Value objects own validation and pure behavior.
Promote value objects to `values/` only when they are reused; otherwise keep
them local to the concept that uses them.

## Workflow

A durable application process. Workflow declarations belong in `use-cases` when
they are product/application concepts. Runtime workflow handlers belong in
`server`; engines and storage belong in `drivers`.
