> > **SDK status update**  
> `@beep/iam-sdk` now exposes Effect contracts + `*.implementations.ts` wrappers via ContractKit utilities. The former `AuthHandler.make` helpers and `iam` facade are gone. Every “Implementation” task below should be satisfied by wiring the corresponding contract implementation (for example `SignInImplementations.SignInEmailContract`) through runtime runners and UI surfaces.

## How to use this checklist

Follow the [`BETTER_AUTH_CLIENT_METHOD_PROCESS.md`](BETTER_AUTH_CLIENT_METHOD_PROCESS.md) SOP for the full workflow. For each unchecked method below:

1. **Load documentation context**
   - `context7__resolve-library-id {"libraryName":"better-auth"}`
   - `context7__get-library-docs {"context7CompatibleLibraryID":"/better-auth/better-auth","topic":"<relevant topic>","tokens":800}`
   - `jetbrains__search_in_files_by_text {"projectPath":"/home/elpresidank/YeeBois/projects/beep-effect","pathInProject":"better-auth-api-spec.json","searchText":"\"/<api path>\"","maxUsageCount":3,"timeout":120000,"useRegex":false}` (returns a focused snippet from the large OpenAPI JSON—no custom scripts needed)
2. **Open the matching domain model** (must precede contract edits)
   - `jetbrains__get_file_text_by_path {"projectPath":"/home/elpresidank/YeeBois/projects/beep-effect","pathInProject":"packages/iam/domain/src/entities/<Entity>/<Entity>.model.ts"}` or  
     `jetbrains__get_file_text_by_path {"projectPath":"/home/elpresidank/YeeBois/projects/beep-effect","pathInProject":"packages/shared/domain/src/entities/<Entity>/<Entity>.model.ts"}`
   - Confirm which selectors (`Model.select/insert/update`) power the payloads and note any missing fields that require orchestrator follow-up.
3. **Author / update contracts** using `BS.Class` schemas and register them with the appropriate `ContractKit`.
4. **Implement handlers** with `makeFailureContinuation`, `Effect.fn`, and `client.<plugin>.<method>`; remember to `client.$store.notify("$sessionSignal")` when sessions mutate.
5. **Export everything** via the feature `index.ts`, encode/decode payloads with the same contract schema that the domain model defined, and run `bun run build --filter=@beep/iam-sdk` (plus targeted lint/tests when appropriate). `ParseError` handlers must call `Effect.fail(IamError.match(...))` instead of `Effect.dieMessage`.
6. **Mark progress** by checking off the corresponding items in this file once code, model alignment, and verification are complete.

Each method entry below lists canonical references: Better Auth docs, local contract/implementation files, runtime/UI consumers, and expected payload semantics. Add more granular notes inline if a method requires additional guards or cross-slice updates.

### Domain alignment tracker

| Cluster | Domain model verified | Derived from Model.* | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Base / Verify | ⬜ | ⬜ | Align with `packages/shared/domain/src/entities/User/User.model.ts` and `packages/iam/domain/src/entities/Verification/Verification.model.ts` before adding new flows. |
| Admin | ⬜ | ⬜ | Use `packages/shared/domain/src/entities/User/User.model.ts`, `packages/iam/domain/src/entities/Member/Member.model.ts`, and log mismatches in `ADMIN_CLIENT_WORKING_NOTES.md`. |
| Api Key | ✅ `packages/iam/domain/src/entities/ApiKey/ApiKey.model.ts` | ✅ Contracts/handlers mirror `ApiKey.Model.select/insert/update` (canonical example—mirror this pattern) | Treat this slice as the reference implementation for future clusters. |
| Anonymous | ⬜ | ⬜ | Confirm guest session fields against `packages/shared/domain/src/entities/User/User.model.ts` and the anonymous session adapters. |
| Device Authorization | ⬜ | ⬜ | Ensure payloads reuse `packages/iam/domain/src/entities/DeviceCode/DeviceCode.model.ts` selectors. |
| OIDC Provider | ⬜ | ⬜ | Derive schemas from `packages/iam/domain/src/entities/OAuthApplication/OAuthApplication.model.ts` and related models. |
| Multi-Session | ⬜ | ⬜ | Reference `packages/iam/domain/src/entities/Session/Session.model.ts` and `DeviceCode` where applicable. |
| Passkey | ✅ | ✅ | Reuse `packages/iam/domain/src/entities/Passkey/Passkey.model.ts` for view/payload fields. |
| Phone Number | ⬜ | ⬜ | Pull phone metadata from `packages/shared/domain/src/entities/User/User.model.ts` and `packages/iam/domain/src/entities/Verification/Verification.model.ts`. |
| Organization (core) | ⬜ | ⬜ | Start from `packages/shared/domain/src/entities/Organization/Organization.model.ts` plus `Member` and `OrganizationRole` models. |
| Organization (teams) | ⬜ | ⬜ | Derive from `packages/iam/domain/src/entities/TeamMember/TeamMember.model.ts` and related organization models. |
