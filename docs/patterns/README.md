# Implementation Patterns

This directory contains detailed documentation of implementation patterns used throughout the project. These patterns provide reusable solutions and best practices for Effect TypeScript development.
The file names directly correspond to the `effect` / `@effect` packages used in the project. for example `effect-Arbitrary.md` would be for `effect/Arbitrary`.
## Patterns

- **[http-api.md](@effect-platform-HttpApi.md)** - HTTP API definition and implementation patterns using Effect platform
- **[layer-composition.md](layer-composition.md)** - Layer-based dependency injection and service composition patterns  
- **[generic-testing.md](generic-testing.md)** - General testing patterns with @effect/vitest and Effect ecosystem

## Usage

Each pattern document includes:
- Core concepts and principles
- Code examples from the implementation
- Best practices and guidelines
- Common pitfalls to avoid

These patterns serve as reference material for future development and help maintain consistency across the codebase.
