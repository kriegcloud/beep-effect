The thundering herd problem is ==a situation where many processes or threads simultaneously contend for the same resource, causing a surge of requests that can overwhelm a system==. It typically occurs when many waiting processes are all awakened at once by an event, like a cache expiring or a service outage, but only one can access the resource at a time. This leads to a cascade of failed requests and retries, potentially causing a system to crash or become unresponsive.
