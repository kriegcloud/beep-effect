# AI Metrics Stack Plan

This plan executes [SPEC.md](./SPEC.md). The credited P6 proof remains active,
and the latest implementation target was the constrained P7a/b slice that could
ship without disturbing that proof. P0 bootstrap, P1 source/privacy proof, P2
durable ingest, P3 OTLP/backend contracts, P4 report-first scorecards, P5
install/remote deployment, P6a fresh-review hardening, and P6b proof-runner
isolation are complete. P7a/b hybrid mirror and retention workflows are now
implemented. P6c remains the active closeout gate until the credited proof can
finish on May 16, 2026 02:26 America/Chicago. P7e is the V1 production
readiness closeout that records the final seven-day report and confirmed
sanitized mirror. P7c provider/gateway metrics and P7d dashboard/backend
expansion remain follow-up capabilities, not blockers for V1 completion.
Phoenix is live on dankserver, Pulumi state is reconciled, and the workstation
timer owns live collection from an isolated pinned proof worktree.

## P0: Initiative Bootstrap And Current State

Status: completed

- Create `@beep/repo-ai-metrics` with schema-first models, tolerant JSONL
  ingest summaries, benchmark/scorecard models, and target-agnostic install
  specs.
- Add `beep-cli ai-metrics` command scaffolding for install preview, ingest,
  forwarder, and benchmark workflows.
- Add `@beep/infra` `AIMetricsStack` as an import-safe Pulumi contract.
- Record current gaps in `history/outputs/p0-current-state.md`.

## P1: Source Discovery And Privacy

Status: completed

- Added source discovery for Codex, Claude Code, and OpenClaw safe gateway
  metadata, with configurable repo/home/unit roots, last-seven-days defaults,
  `--since`, `--max-files`, and `--all`.
- Replaced the install-spec hardcoded transcript assumption with source
  discovery, config snapshot, and privacy-check planned commands.
- Added redaction result schemas, hash-only raw event envelopes, sanitized
  transcript projections, and salted private identifier hashes.
- Added deterministic config snapshots for `.codex`, `.claude`, `.ai`,
  `.aiassistant`, `AGENTS.md`, and `CLAUDE.md`, excluding `.repos`,
  `node_modules`, generated, cache, and build roots.
- Added synthetic tests and CLI smoke tests proving raw prompt/output text,
  secrets, and private local paths do not leak into derived JSON outputs.
- Recorded evidence in
  [history/outputs/p1-source-discovery-and-privacy.md](./history/outputs/p1-source-discovery-and-privacy.md).

## P2: Durable Ingest And Derived Storage

Status: completed

- Added `@beep/duckdb` as the driver-level DuckDB boundary, using the official
  DuckDB Node API and DuckDB `COPY ... FORMAT parquet` export path.
- Added AES-256-GCM encrypted raw archive objects under the target data root,
  keyed by `sourceKind + sourcePathHash + plaintextContentHash`.
- Added durable forwarder ingest for Codex and Claude JSONL plus OpenClaw safe
  gateway metadata, with config snapshot attribution.
- Materialized derived DuckDB tables for ingest runs, source files, raw archive
  objects, sessions, turns, and empty future-ready model/tool/label/benchmark
  and scorecard tables.
- Exported all derived tables to per-run Parquet snapshots.
- Added an internal in-memory Effect EventLog proof for sanitized turn
  projection.
- Recorded evidence in
  [history/outputs/p2-durable-ingest-and-derived-storage.md](./history/outputs/p2-durable-ingest-and-derived-storage.md).

## P3: OTLP And Backend Stack

Status: completed

- Use core Effect `Metric`, `Tracer`, `Logger`, `LogLevel`, `ErrorReporter`,
  `Clock`, and `Redacted` APIs as the instrumentation vocabulary.
- Export through stable `@effect/opentelemetry/NodeSdk.layer` for v1, with a
  trace-only `@beep/observability` Node SDK helper using protobuf OTLP HTTP
  exporters for Phoenix smoke targets.
- Keep `effect/unstable/observability` and `effect/unstable/devtools` as later
  or experimental references.
- Added generated local Phoenix compose smoke target and kept Langfuse, Opik,
  and PostHog behind install/export contracts instead of backend-specific
  drivers.
- Add low-cardinality OTLP attribute policy for agent, source, provider, model,
  config snapshot, and outcome labels.
- Added redacted derived DuckDB to OTLP span projection and CLI export workflow.
- Recorded evidence in
  [history/outputs/p3-otlp-and-backend-stack.md](./history/outputs/p3-otlp-and-backend-stack.md).

## P4: Scorecards, Labels, And Benchmarks

Status: completed

- Added deterministic `AgentTask` projection rows linked to sessions through
  hash-only deploy-safe metadata.
- Added scriptable `ai-metrics label queue` and `label add` workflows with
  structured labels, redacted notes, and config-snapshot attribution.
- Added deploy-safe benchmark case and recorded run workflows linked to config
  snapshots without storing prompt text in derived tables.
- Added `ai-metrics report weekly` to generate Markdown and JSON weekly
  config-impact reports from derived DuckDB tables.
- Recorded evidence in
  [history/outputs/p4-scorecards-labels-and-benchmarks.md](./history/outputs/p4-scorecards-labels-and-benchmarks.md).

## P5: Install And Remote Deployment

Status: completed

- P5a completed: added typed install plan, install doctor, and dry-run apply
  contracts plus CLI workflows. Recorded evidence in
  [history/outputs/p5a-operator-contract-and-dry-run-apply.md](./history/outputs/p5a-operator-contract-and-dry-run-apply.md).
- P5b implementation complete: `@beep/infra` now uses Pulumi remote command
  resources to preflight dankserver, render the Phoenix compose and user
  systemd unit, configure dedicated Tailscale Serve HTTPS on port `8447`, and
  run health checks. Recorded evidence in
  [history/outputs/p5b-real-pulumi-remote-apply.md](./history/outputs/p5b-real-pulumi-remote-apply.md).
- P5b live deployment completed over SSH using the same remote commands the
  Pulumi component owns. Phoenix is verified at
  `https://dankserver.tailc7c348.ts.net:8447`.
- The AI metrics 1Password refs now resolve at
  `op://TBK/ai-metrics/hash-salt` and
  `op://TBK/ai-metrics/raw-archive-key`.
- The first live forwarder run wrote encrypted raw archive metadata, derived
  DuckDB/Parquet state, and redacted OTLP traces. Recorded evidence in
  [history/outputs/p6-seven-day-proof-and-hardening.md](./history/outputs/p6-seven-day-proof-and-hardening.md).
- P5b Pulumi state reconciliation completed on May 9, 2026:
  `pulumi preview -s beep-ai-metrics-dankserver --non-interactive --diff` and
  `pulumi up -s beep-ai-metrics-dankserver --yes --non-interactive` passed,
  stack state has 6 resources, and live Phoenix reports version `15.5.0`.
- Preserve local as the repeatable smoke target.

## P6: Seven-Day Proof And Hardening

Status: in progress

- Preserve the first real collection/export proof as baseline evidence.
- The credited seven-day proof restarted after P6a closeout gates passed.
- During the restarted window, keep live collection owned by the workstation
  timer and maintain completion-creditable scorecards with real labels and
  benchmark runs.
- Isolate the runner from normal repo work by running the workstation timer from
  the locked sibling worktree
  `/home/elpresidank/YeeBois/projects/beep-effect-worktrees/ai-metrics-p6-proof`,
  pinned at `63c419721c735bfb860ccfa9bf1b31efbb23e33c`, while keeping the
  proof data root at
  `/home/elpresidank/YeeBois/projects/beep-effect/.beep/ai-metrics`.
- Use the daily runbook in
  [history/outputs/p6-proof-runner-isolation-and-runbook.md](./history/outputs/p6-proof-runner-isolation-and-runbook.md).
- Track pre-closeout readiness evidence in
  [history/outputs/p6-pre-may16-readiness-ledger.md](./history/outputs/p6-pre-may16-readiness-ledger.md).
- The May 12 P6c label gate is closed for the active isolated-runner config:
  the human-approved label for
  `agent-task-f86914324ec15a092d633bbc488c0805753ffcad47f05264fe7856cc94a899fd`
  flipped
  `config-6c5738fd0e1932ced6043ab52c7df04e52278b1024470769243b724c265f7d52`
  to `completionReady=true` in the intermediate report.
- Additional labels require explicit human outcome judgment. Benchmark runs may
  be recorded for real operator workflows with deploy-safe prompt hashes and
  redacted notes.

## P6a: Fresh Review Data And Ops Hardening

Status: completed

- Preserve Codex subagent attribution through source discovery, privacy
  projection, derived DuckDB/Parquet, OTLP span attributes, and label queues
  using source role plus hash-only parent/session/thread metadata.
- Replace global forwarder source starvation with source-aware per-source
  budgets and coverage reporting for Codex, Claude Code, and OpenClaw gateway
  metadata.
- Persist config snapshot manifests and latest pointers so scorecards can
  distinguish included config files from actual added, modified, and removed
  paths.
- Make weekly scorecards report `completionReady=false` until at least one
  outcome label and one benchmark run exist for the scored config snapshot.
  Provider/model/tool/token/cost metrics remain explicit
  `*_unavailable_not_scored` gaps until real integrations populate them.
- Add an explicit OTLP metadata allowlist and keep subagent/source identifiers
  hash-only in derived exports.
- Add a workstation systemd user timer render path for live collection with
  lock, retry/backoff, status artifact, and journal evidence. True server-owned
  collection remains a P7 topology target.
- Add an archive decrypt drill that verifies one encrypted raw archive object
  without printing transcript text.
- Update install/runbook commands so 1Password refs are separate from runtime
  values: commands that need the raw archive key must export
  `BEEP_AI_METRICS_RAW_ARCHIVE_KEY="$(op read '<ref>')"`.
- Reconciled Pulumi before restarting the credited proof: preview/apply/health
  passed and live Phoenix version matches declared stack config.
- Documented retention, deletion, archive decrypt, backup, restore, and proof
  restart policy in the P6a closeout output.
- Recorded closeout and proof restart evidence in
  [history/outputs/p6a-closeout-proof-restart.md](./history/outputs/p6a-closeout-proof-restart.md).

## P7: Topology-First Productionization

Status: in progress

- Preserve the credited P6 proof while implementing only the P7 work that does
  not mutate the active proof runner, pinned proof worktree, timer budgets,
  source window, or privacy contract.
- P7a implemented: raw encrypted transcripts remain workstation-local, while a
  sanitized derived mirror bundle can be built under
  `<dataRoot>/mirror/bundles/<bundleId>`. The bundle contains `manifest.json`,
  `status/mirror-status.json`, and Parquet exports from an explicit P7-safe
  table allowlist. Raw archive tables, transcript bodies, local source paths,
  archive paths, DuckDB paths, and encryption material are excluded from the
  synced payload.
- P7a implemented: added `beep ai-metrics mirror build`, `mirror sync`, and
  `mirror status`. `mirror sync` is dry-run by default and requires
  `--confirm p7-derived-mirror` before rsync writes to
  `/srv/data/ai-metrics/p7-derived-mirror` over SSH.
- P7b implemented: added `beep ai-metrics retention list`,
  `retention restore-drill`, `retention delete`, and `retention compact`.
  Delete and compact default to dry-run and require both an explicit time
  window and `--confirm p7-retention-window` for real mutation. The restore
  drill verifies decrypt plus content-hash integrity and replays into a
  disposable derived root without printing transcript text.
- P7b implemented: `@beep/infra` now models the remote mirror root as
  `remoteMirrorRoot` with default `/srv/data/ai-metrics/p7-derived-mirror`.
  Before May 16, 2026 this remains preview-only infra state; live proofs can
  use the CLI mirror workflow without changing the active proof runner.
- V1 pending: P7e production-readiness closeout after the P6 proof window
  elapses. P7e must generate the final seven-day report, build a sanitized
  derived mirror from the active data root, run confirmed `mirror sync` to
  `/srv/data/ai-metrics/p7-derived-mirror`, and verify remote mirror status.
- Follow-up, not V1-blocking: P7c provider/model/tool/token/cost enrichment,
  P7d dashboard/backend expansion, and remote mirror lifecycle automation
  beyond confirmed bundle sync/status.
- Planning packet:
  [history/outputs/p7-topology-first-production-plan.md](./history/outputs/p7-topology-first-production-plan.md).
