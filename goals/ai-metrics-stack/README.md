# AI Metrics Stack

## Status

Active

## Overview

This initiative owns the end-to-end developer AI metrics stack for this repo.
It turns Codex, Claude Code, OpenClaw, xAI, Venice.ai, and optional LiteLLM
gateway activity into privacy-safe raw archives, derived rollups, OTLP traces,
and weekly scorecards that answer whether agent-facing config changes improved
coding-agent performance.

Production-complete V1 means the dankserver tailnet stack is deployed, local
smoke collection works, P6a hardening gates pass, real sources are flowing, one
restarted seven-day config-impact scorecard has been generated from live data,
and a sanitized derived mirror has been confirmed on dankserver. Provider and
dashboard enrichment remain follow-up work when the scorecard explicitly marks
those metrics unavailable and not scored.

## Current Progress

P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6a, P6b, and P7a/b are complete enough to use as the
starting checkpoint. The first real collection/export proof remains baseline
evidence; the credited seven-day proof restarted on May 9, 2026 02:26
America/Chicago after the P6a closeout gates passed:

- `@beep/repo-ai-metrics` exists with schema-first models, tolerant transcript
  ingest summaries, target-agnostic install specs, benchmark and scorecard
  models.
- `beep-cli ai-metrics` exists with install preview, ingest, source discovery,
  config snapshot, privacy check, durable forwarder, OTLP export, labels,
  benchmark records, and weekly report generation.
- `@beep/infra` exposes an import-safe `AIMetricsStack` Pulumi component and
  Pulumi entrypoint.
- Source discovery covers Codex, Claude Code, and OpenClaw safe gateway
  metadata without emitting private local paths or service secrets.
- Config snapshots hash repo-owned `.codex`, `.claude`, `.ai`, `.aiassistant`,
  `AGENTS.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` inputs while excluding vendored/generated roots.
- Privacy checks emit sanitized transcript summaries and hash-only event
  envelopes, with synthetic and real local smoke evidence.
- The durable forwarder writes AES-256-GCM encrypted raw archive objects,
  derived DuckDB tables, and per-run Parquet exports.
- P6a adds source-aware forwarder budgets, hash-only Codex subagent parentage,
  config snapshot diff artifacts, scorecard completion readiness, an OTLP
  metadata allowlist, a workstation timer render path, and an archive decrypt
  drill.
- P3 adds install-owned OTLP/Phoenix contracts, generated local Phoenix compose
  smoke, trace-only `@beep/observability` wiring, redacted DuckDB-to-OTLP span
  export, CLI `otlp export`, and import-safe Pulumi backend outputs.
- P4 adds deploy-safe agent task projection rows, structured outcome labels,
  recorded benchmark cases/runs, coverage-aware scorecards, and Markdown/JSON
  weekly report artifacts.
- P5a adds typed install plans, install doctor checks, and dry-run-only apply
  output for local and dankserver targets without resolving secrets, probing
  SSH, or mutating local/remote state.
- P5b adds `@beep/infra` Pulumi remote command resources for dankserver
  preflight, Phoenix compose/systemd apply, dedicated
  `https://dankserver.tailc7c348.ts.net:8447` Tailscale Serve routing, and
  health checks.
- Pulumi state reconciliation has passed for `beep-ai-metrics-dankserver`;
  stack state now has 6 resources and live Phoenix reports version `15.5.0`.
- The AI metrics 1Password refs resolve at
  `op://TBK/ai-metrics/hash-salt` and
  `op://TBK/ai-metrics/raw-archive-key`.
- The first live P6 proof collected 10 Codex source files, projected 23,830
  turns, exported 23,840 redacted OTLP spans to Phoenix, generated a baseline
  weekly report, and confirmed Phoenix GraphQL has traces.
- P6a closeout installed the workstation systemd user timer, ran one owned
  bounded forwarder pass, reran the archive drill, reconciled Pulumi, verified
  Phoenix `15.5.0`, added one outcome label plus one benchmark run, and
  generated a restarted scorecard with `completionReady=true`.
- P6 isolation now runs the workstation timer from locked detached worktree
  `/home/elpresidank/YeeBois/projects/beep-effect-worktrees/ai-metrics-p6-proof`
  pinned at `63c419721c735bfb860ccfa9bf1b31efbb23e33c`, while preserving the
  original proof data root under the main checkout.
- P7a/b adds the hybrid derived mirror and local-first retention workflows.
  Raw encrypted transcripts remain workstation-local; mirror bundles contain
  only sanitized manifests, status artifacts, reports, and allowed derived
  Parquet exports. Retention delete and compact workflows remain dry-run until
  an explicit window plus `--confirm p7-retention-window` are supplied.
- Source discovery remains Codex-only in the recent proof window; `--all`
  discovery confirms Claude Code and OpenClaw sources exist outside the active
  proof window and are deferred to P7c provider/gateway work.
- Current P6 work is to keep the timer running through May 16, 2026 02:26
  America/Chicago and generate the final seven-day report.
- The May 12 P6c label pass added one explicit human-approved outcome label for
  the isolated-runner config and regenerated an intermediate report where that
  config is `completionReady=true`. The remaining P6 blocker is elapsed proof
  time.
- P7e production-readiness closeout remains the V1 closeout pass after May 16.
  It must record the final report and confirm a sanitized derived mirror on
  dankserver.
- P7c provider/gateway metrics, P7d dashboard/backend expansion, and remote
  mirror lifecycle automation beyond confirmed bundle sync/status remain
  follow-up work, not V1 blockers.

## Completion Standard

This initiative is done only when all are true:

- dankserver tailnet deployment is applied and verified
- Phoenix is receiving real traces or derived exports
- raw encrypted archive and redacted derived views are populated
- P6a hardening gates have passed, including subagent attribution, source-aware
  coverage, config diffs, metadata allowlist, timer ownership, and archive
  decrypt drill
- Codex source discovery and ingest are proven, Claude Code/OpenClaw adapter
  visibility is explicit, and optional gateway/provider metrics either contain
  measured rows or are explicitly unavailable and not scored
- config snapshots are linked to real sessions and benchmark runs
- CLI label review produces outcome labels for real work
- one weekly config-impact scorecard is generated from a restarted seven-day
  live window and is marked completion-ready with labels plus benchmark evidence
- a sanitized derived mirror is confirmed on dankserver after the final
  seven-day report
- provider/tool/cost fields either contain real measured rows or are explicitly
  reported as unavailable and not scored
