# <Goal Title> Plan

## Status

Status: `pending`

## Phases

| Phase | Status | Goal | Exit criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 Research | pending | Inspect source hierarchy and confirm scope. | Required facts and blockers are recorded. |
| P1 Implement | pending | Make the smallest changes that satisfy `SPEC.md`. | Acceptance criteria are met. |
| P2 Verify | pending | Run required checks and capture evidence. | Verification is green or blockers are documented. |
| P3 Close | pending | Prepare PR, review response, and final readiness if requested. | Packet status and evidence are updated. |

## Execution Notes

- Preserve unrelated worktree changes.
- Keep `SPEC.md` normative and update it only when the contract changes.
- Keep this plan current; archive old run outputs under `history/`.
