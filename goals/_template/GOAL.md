# GOAL: <short imperative outcome>

Repo: `/home/elpresidank/YeeBois/projects/beep-effect`.

Outcome: <one sentence describing the final state this execution must reach>.

This is a compact `/goal` launcher. Treat the packet files as the detailed
contract:

- `goals/<slug>/README.md`
- `goals/<slug>/SPEC.md`
- `goals/<slug>/PLAN.md`
- `goals/<slug>/ops/manifest.json`

Read those first, then read `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and any governing
standards named by `SPEC.md`. Higher-priority repo standards outrank packet
prose when they conflict.

Scope:

- In: <paths, packages, docs, workflows, or artifacts this goal may change>.
- Out: <non-goals and areas not to touch>.

Workflow:

1. Inspect referenced files and current repo state.
2. Make the smallest change that satisfies `SPEC.md`.
3. Preserve unrelated user/worktree changes.
4. Keep decisions tied to evidence from files, tests, docs, or command output.
5. Update packet evidence/status if the implementation changes readiness.
6. At P3 Close, write a closeout reflection to
   `history/reflections/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<agent>.md` via the `/reflect` skill (see
   `PLAN.md` P3 Closeout Checklist); `bun run beep lint reflection-artifacts`
   must pass.

Acceptance:

- [ ] `SPEC.md` acceptance criteria are satisfied.
- [ ] Required verification commands pass, or unrelated failures are reproduced
      and recorded separately.
- [ ] No unrelated refactors or formatting churn.

Verification:

```sh
test "$(wc -m < goals/<slug>/GOAL.md)" -le 4000
jq . goals/<slug>/ops/manifest.json
git diff --check -- goals/<slug>
```

Stop and report before changing public API, schema, data migration, auth, infra,
security behavior, dependencies, lockfiles, generated files, or destructive
state unless `SPEC.md` explicitly requires it.

Done only when acceptance passes and verification is complete, or when a blocker
is reported with file/command evidence.
