# Codex Security Findings (2026-10-14)

## Status

Lifecycle: `active`

Source: [`ops/manifest.json`](./ops/manifest.json)

## Mission

Capture, validate, remediate, and close every open Codex Cloud security finding
for `kriegcloud/beep-effect` in the 2-finding batch captured on 2026-10-14.
Ship the fixes through one Yeet-driven PR, close the exact captured findings, and
leave no packet-applicable finding open.

## Launch

```text
/goal follow the instructions in goals/codex-security-findings-2026-10-14-l0-ledger/GOAL.md
```

`GOAL.md` is the compact launcher. `SPEC.md` remains the normative contract.

## Read This First

1. [`GOAL.md`](./GOAL.md)
2. [`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md)
3. [`PLAN.md`](./PLAN.md)
4. [`ops/manifest.json`](./ops/manifest.json)
5. [`ops/triage.json`](./ops/triage.json)
6. [`findings/INDEX.md`](./findings/INDEX.md)

## Current Phase

`P5 repo-proof` - both findings are confirmed at current HEAD and repaired in
two disjoint code surfaces. The focused suite passes; package and Yeet proof,
publication, merge, and exact Cloud closure remain.

## Findings at a glance

1 High, 1 Medium findings. Accepted risk is unavailable; each item must be
fixed or closed only with strict proof that the report is already fixed or
materially invalid.

## Notes

- Raw report bodies remain untracked under `raw/`; tracked files are sanitized.
- Do not use Codex's Create PR or patch-apply controls.
- Browser closure is post-merge and must match the captured Codex ID allowlist.
