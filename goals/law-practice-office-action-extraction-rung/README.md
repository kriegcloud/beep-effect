# Law-Practice Office-Action Extraction Rung

## Status

Lifecycle: `complete` (2026-06-18)

Source: [`ops/manifest.json`](./ops/manifest.json)

## Mission

Graduate the law-practice office-action loop beyond the rung-0 fixed candidate
list by invoking the provider-neutral `@beep/langextract` service, preserving
span-grounded `GroundedExtraction[]`, and adding enough adverse extraction cases
to make the next doctrine breadth slice safe.

## Launch

Use this command for execution-capable sessions:

```text
/goal follow the instructions in goals/law-practice-office-action-extraction-rung/GOAL.md
```

`GOAL.md` is the compact launcher. `SPEC.md` remains the normative contract.

## Current Phase

`P3 Verify and close` is complete. Production `OfficeActionReview` invokes
`LangExtractService.extract`, feeds `LangExtractResult.extractions` to
`IrToLaw`, rejects missing/empty/unaligned required extraction output before
claim admission, and PR #265 carries the Yeet-published branch.

## Latest Evidence

- P0/P1 - current seams confirmed: fixed spike candidates were only in
  `OfficeActionReview.service.ts`, `LangExtractService.extract` takes a
  schema-backed `LangExtractRequest`, and server Layer composition can require a
  generic `LanguageModel.LanguageModel` without provider-specific law-practice
  dependencies.
- P1/P2 - production `OfficeActionReview` now constructs law extraction targets
  (`office_action`, `claim`, `rejection_reference`, `distinction`), calls
  `LangExtractService.extract`, and passes `LangExtractResult.extractions` into
  `IrToLaw`.
- P2 - `IrToLaw` now returns typed `IrToLawExtractionError` failures for
  missing, empty, or unaligned required labels instead of fabricating fallback
  spans.
- P2 - deterministic server test has 4 passing cases: LangExtract-backed
  grounding, happy-path review through fake model output, missing distinction
  rejection, and unaligned distinction rejection before admission.
- P2 - doctrine breadth is explicitly deferred to the next rung: multi-reference
  103 plus 101/112 handling stays out of this extraction-service graduation.
- P3 - local focused tests, package checks/lints, root `bun run check`, and
  `bun run beep yeet verify` with optional live-provider tokens blanked are
  green as of 2026-06-18.
- P3 - `bun run beep yeet publish --pr --monitor --message
  "feat(law-practice): service-backed office action extraction"` opened PR #265;
  hosted monitor reported 20 checks, 0 failing, 0 pending. Initial strict
  closeout surfaced 5 actionable review threads and a Greptile 3/5 issue; the
  follow-up closeout patch addresses those review findings before final
  monitor/closeout.

## Source material

Gold-intake provenance for the folded relational-grid pattern lives in
[`research/SOURCES.md`](./research/SOURCES.md): the `mike#13` nugget, its
AGPL-3.0 upstream + clean-room discipline, the external review-UX citations, and
the `@beep/*` bricks it composes. Source exploration dir:
[`explorations/_gold-intake/`](../../explorations/_gold-intake/) (cluster
"Relational grounded-extraction grid (per-cell citations)"). The folded note is
[`research/gold-intake-relational-extraction-grid.md`](./research/gold-intake-relational-extraction-grid.md).

## Notes

- The fixed `OfficeActionReviewSpikeCandidates` list is retained only through
  the package test surface for deterministic mapping assertions.
- Keep tests deterministic with fake language-model output; live provider
  credentials are not required for packet completion.
- Use Yeet for branch proof, PR creation, hosted monitor, and closeout:
  `yeet verify` -> `yeet publish --pr --monitor` -> `yeet monitor --summary`
  -> `yeet closeout --summary ...`.
- The nlp `AnnotatedDocument` envelope is still span-lossy for law anchoring.
  Feed `LangExtractResult.extractions` / `GroundedExtraction[]` into `IrToLaw`.
- Fixtures must remain synthetic/public only.
