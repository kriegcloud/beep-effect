# Lint Advisory Hardening

## Status

Lifecycle: `active`

Source: [`ops/manifest.json`](./ops/manifest.json)

## Mission

Make root lint advisory output actionable by eliminating the current nonfatal
backlog, hardening false-positive-prone checks, and promoting root lint
warnings/advisories to failures in local and PR quality paths.

## Launch

Use this command for execution-capable sessions:

```text
/goal follow the instructions in goals/lint-advisory-hardening/GOAL.md
```

`GOAL.md` is the compact launcher. `SPEC.md` remains the normative contract.

## Read This First

1. [`GOAL.md`](./GOAL.md) - compact `/goal` launcher.
2. [`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md) - normative source of truth.
3. [`PLAN.md`](./PLAN.md) - active execution plan.
4. [`ops/manifest.json`](./ops/manifest.json) - machine-readable routing.
5. [`tasks/tasks.jsonc`](./tasks/tasks.jsonc) - active work queue.
6. [`research/`](./research/) - supporting inventories.
7. [`history/`](./history/) - evidence and closeouts.

## Current Phase

P1 Implement: packet created, implementation in progress on branch
`feat/lint-advisory-hardening`.

## Latest Evidence

[`research/current-lint-advisory-inventory.md`](./research/current-lint-advisory-inventory.md)

## Notes

- V1 scope is root `bun run lint` policy only.
- Fallow advisory lanes are related future work and intentionally out of scope.
- PR CI needs a dedicated unscoped policy lane because affected lint skips
  repo-wide policy checks.
