# Chat Surface Parity Spec

## Objective

Bring the desktop chat surface to **full feature parity** with the
`effect-lexical-chat` POC, closing the gaps the prior `desktop-chat-surface`
port left behind: the dropped observability/devtooling/UX affordances, the
streamed-block validation+repair loop, and the richer block vocabulary
(mermaid, tables, youtube). The atom architecture is already at parity — this
packet does **not** re-do it.

Depends on: `goals/desktop-chat-surface` (closed, `completed-retained`). The
chat surface, turn kernel, `ChatRpcs`, agents-client atoms, and PGlite
persistence it shipped are the substrate this packet extends.

Provenance: graduated from `explorations/agent-chat-interface`. Tables were a
named follow-on in that exploration's MAP. Proof-repo reference (read-only):
`/home/elpresidank/YeeBois/projects/effect-lexical-chat/` (effect catalog
`4.0.0-beta.79`; our repo is on `4.0.0-beta.83` — re-validate API drift).

## Background: the parity audit

An exhaustive POC→port diff (see
[`research/2026-06-15-poc-parity-audit.md`](./research/2026-06-15-poc-parity-audit.md))
classified every divergence into three buckets. This SPEC acts only on the
**in-scope** bucket; the other two are fixed constraints.

### Already at parity — DO NOT touch

`AtomRpc.Service` + `Atom.family` queries + `runtime.fn` mutations + `Atom.kvs`
drafts (our `packages/agents/client/src/Chat.atoms.ts` is a near-verbatim port
of the POC `src/atoms.ts`); `scanChunk` block extraction + its property tests;
`ExecutionPlan` retry (4-attempt exponential backoff, `preventFallbackOnPartialStream`);
client OTLP layer + client-span-context-on-rpc-envelope; stop/interrupt cleanup
via `AtomRegistry`; optimistic edit-truncation; scroll-to-bottom; Ctrl+Enter
submit; composer draft autosave/restore.

### Intentional divergences — PRESERVE (non-goals; must NOT revert to POC)

- `@beep/md` `Document` model is the content representation, **not** Lexical-native state.
- Turn-grouped timeline (not the POC's flat message list); Thread/Workspace domain (not Conversation).
- PGlite + Drizzle (not sqlite-bun); fixture-vs-Anthropic kernel split.
- `ChatActionError` boundary translation (`09-errors-across-boundaries.md`) — internal detail dies at the boundary.
- Client OTLP base-URL via runtime-origin detection (vite-free, NodeNext/Tauri-safe) — superior to the POC's `import.meta.env.VITE_OTLP_URL`.
- **No-partial-row on cancel/error** (LOCKED): cancel/error leaves only the user row. The POC persists partial assistant content; we do not, and this packet keeps it that way.
- Features we already have that the POC lacks: `CostRollup`, edit-branch version selector, `UsageRecord` capture. Keep them.

## Locked decisions

1. **Mermaid representation** = the existing `@beep/md` `Pre` code node with
   `language="mermaid"` (already JSON-safe; no new foundation node). Rendered by
   a language-aware decorator in `@beep/editor` using the `mermaid` lib.
   Mermaid is therefore *not* a dedicated md/lexical node.
2. **Partial persist** = keep ours (no partial assistant row on cancel/error).

## Source Hierarchy

1. User objective that created this packet (full POC parity).
2. `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and required skills.
3. Governing standards (`standards/ARCHITECTURE.md`;
   `standards/architecture/{01,03,05,06,07,08,09,12}-*.md`).
4. This `SPEC.md`. 5. `PLAN.md`. 6. `GOAL.md`. 7. `research/`, `ops/`, `history/`.

Higher sources outrank lower when they conflict.

## Target Surfaces

- `apps/professional-desktop` — sidecar runtime `src/runtime/Observability.ts`
  + `Layer.ts`, app entry `src/main.tsx`, chat orchestrator
  `src/chat/ChatOrchestrator.ts`, chat UI `src/chat/ui/*`, `docker/grafana/`.
- `packages/agents/*` — kernel + `AssistantTurn/*` (server), `AssistantContent`
  + `BlockToMd` (domain), repair port error (use-cases), atoms/error-state (client).
- `packages/drivers/anthropic/*` — one-shot repair call + Haiku model option.
- `packages/foundation/modeling/md` + `packages/foundation/modeling/lexical`
  + `packages/foundation/ui-system/editor` — new table + youtube nodes (mermaid reuses `Pre`).
- `packages/foundation/capability/observability` — reused (DevTools), not modified.

## In-scope work (normative; see PLAN.md for phasing + file touch-points)

### Observability, devtooling & UX gaps
- Sidecar **Effect DevTools** layer, `DEVTOOLS`-gated, composing the existing
  `@beep/observability/server` `layerFilteredDevTools` (compose the capability;
  do NOT hand-roll `effect/unstable/devtools` `DevTools.layer()` in the app).
- App-local **`RegistryProvider`** mirroring `apps/oip-web/src/runtime/OipAtomProvider.tsx`, wrapping the app root.
- **Error toasts** for failed turns via the existing `@beep/ui` sonner — surfaced
  from the app/UI layer (NOT from `@beep/agents-client`, which must not import `@beep/ui`).
- **Turn-lifecycle metrics** in the orchestrator: turns-total, turn-failures, turn-duration, blocks-streamed. (No partial-persist metric — N/A by the locked contract.)
- **Title derivation** from the first user message via the existing `documentToPlainText` helper (`ChatOrchestrator.ts`). NOTE — not zero-foundation: `Thread.title` is a required `S.NonEmptyString`, the app supplies an explicit title at creation, and `ThreadStore` has no title mutation, so set-if-empty needs either a nullable-title schema + migration (a stop-and-report trigger) OR a new `ThreadStore.setTitleIfEmpty` mutation + repo impls + `ChatRpcs` method + atom (decide in P0).
- Provisioned **Grafana chat dashboard**.

### Block validation + repair loop
- Driver repair in `@beep/anthropic` (Haiku via per-call model option, own 2-attempt `ExecutionPlan`) + driver-internal `RepairError`. **API landmine:** the POC uses `streamText` (consume-whole), NOT `generateText`, because the non-streaming path maps tool_use `caller → toolId: undefined` and fails the response Part schema ("Expected JSON value") — this still reproduces at our `beta.83`. P0 must confirm whether `generateText` decodes tool_use at our version; if not, use the POC's `streamText`-consume-whole pattern (POC `server/BlockRepair.ts:98-103`).
- Port error `BlockRepairFailed` (use-cases, `/server` export only). **Prerequisite:** `@beep/agents-use-cases` has no `/server` subpath yet (exports: `.`, `/public`, `/proof`, `/test`) — scaffold `src/server.ts` + the `package.json` export + tsconfig path first, copying `architecture-lab/use-cases` or `workspace/use-cases`. (`TurnGenerationError` currently sits on `/public`; leave it unless it must become server-only.)
- Server adapter `attemptBlockRepair`, error translation, repair metric, repair span; port the POC `IssueReport`.
- **Repair contract (one rule):** a block still invalid after the repair attempts is **dropped + logged** (repair is otherwise infallible, as in the POC); only a failed repair *call* becomes driver `RepairError` → port `BlockRepairFailed` → `ChatActionError` at the handler. The turn fails only on a failed repair call, never because one block could not be repaired.

### Rich blocks
- **Mermaid**: model emits a `code` block with `language="mermaid"`, lifting to `@beep/md` `Pre[language="mermaid"]`. The source validator and the `CheckedMermaidBlock` codec filter are **re-authored** against `CodeBlock` (key on `language==="mermaid"`, read `block.code`) — they do NOT port from the POC's dedicated `MermaidBlock.source` (the happy-dom parse logic is reusable; only its dispatch changes). Render via an `@beep/editor` language-aware diagram decorator (`mermaid` dep) + a streaming-view branch (see two-render note).
- **Table**: new `Table`/`TableRow`/`TableCell` across `@beep/md` + lexical-schema + editor; `TableBlock` + `BlockToMd` lift; arity validator (`CheckedTableBlock` ports faithfully — stays dedicated).
- **YouTube**: dedicated embed node across `@beep/md` + lexical-schema + editor (DecoratorNode); `YouTubeBlock` + lift + 11-char video-id validator (`CheckedYouTubeBlock` ports faithfully).
- Re-add mermaid/table/youtube guidance to the kernel system prompt (mermaid via a `code`+`language="mermaid"` instruction — there is no mermaid tag).
- **Two render paths, not one:** `chat/ui/StreamingBlocks.tsx` renders raw `Turn.AssistantBlock` with no Lexical decode, so the `@beep/editor` decorators cover only the read-only viewer; each rich block also needs a streaming-view render branch. The `mermaid` dep lands wherever a diagram renders (streaming view + editor), not only `@beep/editor`.

## Doctrine risk (binding)

Adding `Table`/`Youtube` nodes to `@beep/md` (and `@beep/lexical-schema` +
`@beep/editor`) changes a **shared foundation contract**. `@beep/md` is broadly
consumed — agents-domain/use-cases/client, workspace-domain/use-cases/server,
`@beep/repo-cli`, and `@beep/lexical-schema` (which re-projects it); `@beep/editor`
today has a single consumer (`apps/professional-desktop`). Per
`07-non-slice-families.md` these are foundation additions, not chat-local. The
implementing session MUST treat them as foundation work, add Md↔Lexical
round-trip + JSON-boundary tests at the foundation level, and verify no
regression in the `@beep/md`/`@beep/lexical-schema` consumers above (NOT
`apps/oip-web`, which imports none of md/lexical/editor). Mermaid avoids this by
reusing `Pre`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Sidecar exposes Effect DevTools when `DEVTOOLS=true` (via `@beep/observability/server`); OTLP unchanged.
- [ ] App wraps the root in an app-local `RegistryProvider`; failed turns surface a toast.
- [ ] Turn-lifecycle metrics emit; a Grafana chat dashboard is provisioned; threads get derived titles.
- [ ] Invalid streamed blocks are repaired (Haiku) where possible (unrepairable ones dropped + logged); repair metric + span emit; a failed repair *call* dies at the handler as `ChatActionError`.
- [ ] Mermaid (`Pre[language=mermaid]`), table, and youtube blocks stream, validate, persist as `@beep/md`, and render in both the streaming view and the read-only viewer.
- [ ] New foundation nodes have Md↔Lexical round-trip + JSON-boundary tests; no regression in the `@beep/md`/`@beep/lexical-schema` consumers (agents-*, workspace-*, `@beep/repo-cli`).
- [ ] No-partial-row-on-cancel contract preserved; intentional divergences untouched.
- [ ] Repo quality gates pass; no unrelated refactors or formatting churn.

## Stop Conditions

- Required source files are missing or materially contradictory.
- A foundation node addition would regress a shared `@beep/md`/`@beep/lexical-schema` consumer.
- The implementation would exceed named parity scope.
- The no-partial-row contract is challenged by a parity change.
- The same blocker repeats after reasonable investigation.
- The dependency packet (`desktop-chat-surface`) is not closed.

## Decision Log

- 2026-06-15: Scope = **full feature parity** (user-selected over "accidental gaps only" and "gaps + repair only").
- 2026-06-15: Mermaid = `Pre[language="mermaid"]` (not a dedicated node).
- 2026-06-15: Keep no-partial-row-on-cancel (do not adopt the POC's partial persist).
- 2026-06-15 (review pass): corrected the doctrine-risk consumer set (oip-web is not an editor consumer); flagged the `generateText` vs `streamText` `beta.83` tool_use landmine (P0 gate); noted the `@beep/agents-use-cases/server` subpath prerequisite; reconciled the repair contract (drop unrepairable, fail only on a failed repair call); re-scoped title derivation. See the research note's review-corrections addendum.
- Inherited from `explorations/agent-chat-interface/DECISIONS.md` (2026-06-12):
  version-selector branching, UsageRecord at finalization, thread content exempt from gating.
