# Box Driver Specification

## Status

**PENDING IMPLEMENTATION**

Created on 2026-06-04 as a packet-authoring pass. The `@beep/box` package is
scaffolded (config + `BoxError` exist; the service is a stub and models are
empty), but the full-surface driver is not implemented.

## Owner

@beep-team

## Purpose

The repository needs a robust Box technical driver so product slices and app
adapters can consume Box content management (files, folders, uploads/downloads,
search, shared links, collaborations, metadata, tasks, webhooks, trash, sign
requests, hubs, AI, retention, legal holds, shield, and the rest of the Box
platform) without depending directly on the raw `box-node-sdk`, thrown SDK
errors, raw API failures, or unbounded external wire shapes.

`@beep/box` is not product language. It is a dev-safe wrapper around an external
SDK and service. Because the Box surface is very large (~80 managers, ~305
methods, ~301 models), the model and wrapper layers are **code-generated** from
the SDK's own TypeScript types rather than hand-written.

## Architecture Contract

`@beep/box` lives in the flat repo-level `drivers` family:

```txt
packages/drivers/box -> @beep/box
```

This follows the binding rule that external SDKs, services, engines, frameworks,
and browser platform wrappers belong in `drivers/*` (`07-non-slice-families.md`,
`03-driver-boundaries.md`).

The driver may:

- wrap `box-node-sdk` v10.11.1;
- generate and expose schema-first models and per-manager service methods;
- define technical driver errors (`BoxError`);
- provide live and fake Layers;
- provide read-only live smoke tests gated by `CLOUD_BOX_TOKEN`;
- expose binary/streaming surfaces (downloads, uploads, chunked uploads, zip
  downloads, events) as Effect-native streams.

The driver must not:

- import product slices, product use-cases, product domain models, shared
  product language, UI, apps, app-local runtime wiring, or product policy
  (`03-driver-boundaries.md`: only `server` and `tables` may import drivers);
- translate technical Box failures into product-facing action errors
  (`09-errors-across-boundaries.md`: driver/internal errors die at the boundary);
- log or trace tokens, raw request bodies, raw file content, raw PII, or
  unbounded user input (`12-observability.md`);
- expose `@deprecated` SDK methods in the generated surface.

Application policy belongs in consumers. Product-facing consumers translate
technical `BoxError` values at their adapter or use-case boundary.

## Source Hierarchy

Implementation must read sources in this order:

1. User objective captured in this packet.
2. Repo instructions: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and loaded skills.
3. Architecture standards:
   - `standards/ARCHITECTURE.md`
   - `standards/architecture/03-driver-boundaries.md`
   - `standards/architecture/06-configuration-boundaries.md`
   - `standards/architecture/07-non-slice-families.md`
   - `standards/architecture/09-errors-across-boundaries.md`
   - `standards/architecture/12-observability.md`
4. Documentation standards:
   - `.patterns/jsdoc-documentation.md`
5. Generated-driver precedents (the closest model for this work):
   - `packages/drivers/runpod` (custom generator + `S.Class` `_generated`)
   - `packages/drivers/acp` (`@effect/openapi-generator` + `_generated`)
6. Hand-written driver precedents (service/error/test patterns):
   - `packages/drivers/firecrawl`
7. Box SDK source (the generation INPUT and runtime dependency):
   - `node_modules/box-node-sdk/lib/index.d.ts`
   - `node_modules/box-node-sdk/lib/client.d.ts`
   - `node_modules/box-node-sdk/lib/managers/*.d.ts`
   - `node_modules/box-node-sdk/lib/schemas/*.d.ts`
   - `node_modules/box-node-sdk/lib/box/errors.d.ts`
   - `node_modules/box-node-sdk/lib/box/eventStream.d.ts`
8. Box references:
   - `https://developer.box.com/reference/`
   - `https://github.com/box/box-node-sdk`

Current architecture doctrine outranks older packet prose and current code drift.

## Required Skills

The implementation agent must use these repo-local skills or record any
unavailable path and continue with the closest repo-native fallback:

- `$grill-with-docs`
- `$effect-first-development`
- `$schema-first-development`
- `$jsdoc-annotation-specialist`
- `$quality-review-fix-loop`
- `github:yeet`
- `github:gh-fix-ci`
- `github:gh-address-comments`

During packet authoring on 2026-06-04, `$grill-with-docs` was loaded and used to
resolve the design decisions below.

## Package State

The package already exists; **do not** re-run `create-package`. Current state:

- `packages/drivers/box/src/Box.config.ts` — `BoxConfigShape { token: Redacted }`,
  `BoxConfig` service, live `layer` (reads `CLOUD_BOX_TOKEN`), and
  `layerConfig(token)`. Extend this (see Auth/Config Requirements).
- `packages/drivers/box/src/Box.errors.ts` — `BoxError` via `CauseTaggedError`
  with `type/status/code/context_info/help_url/request_id`. Extend with
  translation factories.
- `packages/drivers/box/src/Box.service.ts` — a `"stub"` marker. Replace.
- `packages/drivers/box/src/Box.models.ts` — empty. Replace with a re-export of
  the generated models.
- `package.json` already depends on `box-node-sdk` (`catalog:`) and `@beep/identity`,
  `@beep/schema`. `$BoxId` is registered in `@beep/identity`.

## SDK Dependency Decision

Use the installed `box-node-sdk` v10.11.1. Box's v10 SDK is itself generated
(`sdk-gen`) from the Box OpenAPI spec; it exposes camelCase TypeScript
interfaces with `serialize`/`deserialize` helpers and a `rawData` passthrough,
and performs no runtime validation.

Generate the driver's schemas from the SDK's own `.d.ts`, **not** from the
upstream snake_case Box OpenAPI spec, so decoded schemas match the camelCase
shape the SDK actually returns. The generated surface is version-locked to the
installed SDK; the generator must be re-run when the SDK is upgraded.

## Generation Requirements

A custom generator at `packages/drivers/box/scripts/generate.ts` (runpod
precedent) must:

- read `box-node-sdk` `.d.ts` (managers + schemas) from `node_modules`;
- emit models to `src/_generated/Box.models.gen.ts` and per-manager wrappers to
  `src/_generated/Box.operations.gen.ts`;
- keep `_generated/` internal via package `exports` (`"./_generated/*": null`);
- skip `@deprecated` methods and skip non-JSON methods (returning `ByteStream`,
  `EventStream`, or `undefined`), and **log the dropped lists** (no silent caps);
- add per-export `/** @since @category @example */` JSDoc to generated exports
  (docgen requires it; biome already ignores `*.gen.*`);
- be idempotent: a clean re-run produces no diff;
- run a `biome check --write src/_generated/*.gen.ts` post-pass.

Wire `"generate"`/`"codegen"` scripts into `package.json`.

## Schema Requirements

Use `$schema-first-development`. Generated schemas are the source of truth for
Box wire shapes.

Generated model policy (**pragmatic generated fidelity** — a documented
divergence from firecrawl's hand-crafted Option bar):

- each SDK interface becomes `S.Class<T>($I\`T\`)({...}, $I.annote("T", {...}))`;
- optional fields use `S.optionalKey` (NOT `Option`);
- open enums (`'a' | 'b' | ... | string`) become
  `S.Union([LiteralKit([...known]), S.String])` so unknown values still decode;
- closed literal unions use `LiteralKit`;
- decoding is **permissive**: excess properties and `rawData` are ignored so SDK
  upgrades that add fields do not break decode;
- each non-class schema export pairs with a same-name runtime type alias.

This divergence is justified by scale (301 schemas), Box's open-enum/field
evolution, and the runpod generated precedent. The implementation MUST record it
as a `standards/architecture/DECISIONS.md` entry ("Generated drivers use
pragmatic schema fidelity") following `ADR-FORMAT.md`, and add any named
open-enum helper to `GLOSSARY.md`.

Truly unrepresentable dynamic shapes must be constrained with the narrowest safe
schema (`S.Record(S.String, S.Unknown)` or `S.Unknown`) and documented in the
inventory, never left as `any`.

## Effect Service Requirements

Use `$effect-first-development` and the firecrawl service pattern.

The package must expose an Effect service boundary around the Box SDK:

- Use `Context.Service` and Layers; use the package identity composer `$BoxId`.
- The service value mirrors the SDK managers: per-method wrappers grouped by
  manager (`box.files.getFileById(payload)`), merged with the hand-written
  streaming wrappers.
- A single shared `runSdkCall` helper performs: decode payload → invoke SDK via
  `Effect.tryPromise` → decode success → `Effect.tapError` diagnostics →
  `Effect.withSpan("box.<method>")`.
- Read secrets through Effect `Config` and `Redacted`; never `process.env` in
  service logic.
- Never leak thrown SDK errors or raw thrown values across the service boundary.
- Return decoded success values; fail with typed technical `BoxError` values.

`BoxError` (already defined) must gain translation factories
(`fromUnknown(method, cause)`, `fromReason(...)`) that map `BoxApiError` /
`BoxSdkError` / arbitrary thrown values into a sanitized `BoxError` carrying
method name, status, and decoded failure context — without embedding tokens, raw
request bodies, raw file content, or unbounded user input. Add a `BoxMethodName`
`LiteralKit` and an error-reason `LiteralKit` (firecrawl `Firecrawl.errors.ts`
pattern).

## Streaming Requirement

The non-JSON managers do not fit the JSON decode path and are hand-written in
`packages/drivers/box/src/Box.streaming.ts`:

- `downloads` / `zipDownloads` — return `Stream.Stream<Uint8Array, BoxError>`;
- `uploads` / `chunkedUploads` — accept byte input (`Stream` or bytes) and return
  decoded JSON envelopes;
- `events.getEventStream()` — wrap the long-polling `EventStream` as an Effect
  `Stream` of decoded events using `Stream.callback` + `Effect.acquireRelease`
  so finalizers close the underlying `EventStream` on completion or interruption
  (the direct analog of firecrawl's first-class watcher stream).

Raw byte bodies are not schema-decoded; only JSON envelopes are.

## Auth And Configuration Requirements

Extend `Box.config.ts` while keeping `06-configuration-boundaries.md` boundaries
(secrets via `Redacted`, technical knobs only, never logged):

- keep the developer-token live `layer` reading `CLOUD_BOX_TOKEN` →
  `BoxDeveloperTokenAuth`;
- add a CCG (Client Credentials Grant) config + layer
  (`BoxCcgAuth`: `clientId`, `clientSecret`, optional `enterpriseId`/`userId`);
- add `makeLayerFromClient(client)` so callers can inject any pre-authenticated
  `BoxClient` (covering OAuth2 / JWT App Auth, which are otherwise deferred).

OAuth2 user-delegation and JWT App Auth config layers are out of V1 scope and
must be documented as deferred.

## Observability, Logging, And Tracing

- Technical span names: `box.<method>` (e.g. `box.getFileById`,
  `box.searchForContent`, `box.events.stream`).
- Low-cardinality, sanitized attributes: method name, manager, SDK version,
  status. NO domain-semantic attributes (`12-observability.md`).
- No tokens, raw request bodies, raw file content, raw PII, or unbounded input
  in spans/logs.
- Logs only for noteworthy diagnostics: retries, fallbacks, dropped technical
  details, decoded API failures.

## Documentation Requirements

Use `$jsdoc-annotation-specialist`.

- JSDoc/TSDoc for every exported schema (including generated), service, Layer,
  error, helper, and public type.
- Meaningful examples using the `@beep/box` package alias, not relative imports
  into workspace `src`.
- Schema annotations via `$I.annote`/`$I.annoteSchema` with quality
  descriptions, identifiers, examples, and category/since metadata per
  `.patterns/jsdoc-documentation.md`.
- Docs explain `@beep/box` is a technical Box driver, not a product/domain
  package.
- No `@template`, no type blobs in tags, no `@module`, no examples using `any`,
  type assertions, or deprecated `@effect/schema` imports.
- If `docgen:local` cannot process the generated surface at scale, decide
  whether to exclude `_generated/**` in `docgen.json` and how that interacts
  with the jsdoc inventory; record the decision.

## Testing Requirements

Use `@effect/vitest` best practices.

Required tests:

- Unit tests with a deterministic fake `BoxClient` Layer for representative
  wrapped methods.
- Error translation tests: SDK throws / `BoxApiError` → sanitized `BoxError`.
- Schema decoding tests, including tolerance of unknown fields and unknown
  open-enum values (proving permissive decode + open-enum unions).
- Streaming tests: download `Stream`, events `Stream` emission, and
  interruption/finalizer coverage.
- dtslint tests for public API, service method return types, schema-derived
  types, and `@beep/box` package-alias imports.
- Env-gated read-only live integration smoke tests using `CLOUD_BOX_TOKEN`.

Live tests must be read-only and low-cost:

- Prefer `users.getUserMe` and `folders.getFolderById("0")` (root folder).
- Skip cleanly when `CLOUD_BOX_TOKEN` is absent.
- No create/update/delete in CI.

## Quality And PR Closure Requirements

Use `$quality-review-fix-loop` before PR readiness.

```sh
bunx turbo run check test lint type-test --filter=@beep/box
bunx turbo run test:integration --filter=@beep/box
bun run docgen:local
bun run repo-exports:catalog
bun run repo-exports:catalog:check
bun run lint:fix
bun run audit:github quality
```

Required PR behavior:

- Use branch `feature/beep-box-driver` (already current).
- Commit packet-only work with `feat: add box driver goal packet`.
- Commit implementation work with `feat: add box driver`.
- Open a draft PR after local quality is green.
- Use GitHub skills to babysit CI and review threads.
- After each follow-up commit, comment `@greptileai`, wait for the review, parse
  and report the score, and continue until Greptile reports `5/5`. Mark ready
  only after CI is green, actionable comments are resolved, and Greptile is
  `5/5`.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and report exact evidence if:

- `box-node-sdk` `.d.ts` shapes make a method or model unmodelable after
  reasonable generator effort.
- Live integration tests would incur unexpected cost or destructive side effects.
- `docgen:local` cannot process the generated surface and the exclusion/inventory
  tradeoff needs a human decision.
- A CI failure is unrelated and cannot be reproduced locally after reasonable
  investigation.
- Greptile cannot be triggered or its score cannot be observed after documented
  attempts.
