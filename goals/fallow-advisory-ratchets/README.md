# Fallow Advisory Ratchets

## Status

Lifecycle: `active`

Source: [`ops/manifest.json`](./ops/manifest.json)

## Mission

Implement the next phase after Fallow Quality Enforcement: selected advisory
lanes become narrow, policy-backed ratchets where new debt fails, while
inherited baselines, false positives, and doctrine gaps remain explicit.

This packet is not an instruction to make every Fallow finding fail.

## Launch

Use this command for execution-capable sessions:

```text
/goal follow the instructions in goals/fallow-advisory-ratchets/GOAL.md
```

`GOAL.md` is the compact launcher. `SPEC.md` remains the normative contract.

## Read This First

1. [`GOAL.md`](./GOAL.md) - compact `/goal` launcher.
2. [`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md) - normative source of truth.
3. [`PLAN.md`](./PLAN.md) - phase sequence.
4. [`tasks/tasks.jsonc`](./tasks/tasks.jsonc) - ranked task inventory.
5. [`ops/manifest.json`](./ops/manifest.json) - machine-readable routing.
6. Parent packet: [`goals/fallow-quality-enforcement`](../fallow-quality-enforcement/).
7. Precedent packet: [`goals/fallow-zero-dead-code`](../fallow-zero-dead-code/).

## Ratchet Order

1. `dupes`: first candidate. Use `standards/clone.inventory.jsonc` and
   `bun run beep reuse clones --check` as policy authority. Reconcile Fallow
   dupes before making Fallow dupes blocking.
2. `health`: second candidate. Add calibrated health inventory and fail only
   new or worsened critical/high findings after Effect/schema-heavy calibration.
3. `boundaries`: promote generated boundary config freshness only. Analyzer
   violations and architecture-role legality stay advisory.
4. `flags`: define `standards/feature-flags.inventory.jsonc` before blocking
   unregistered or expired flags.
5. `security`: keep candidate surfacing advisory until triage inventory exists.
6. `fix-preview`: keep dry-run only; possible future gate is parseability.
7. `runtime-coverage` and `editor-mcp-hooks`: deferred pending separate policy.

## Current Decisions

- `audit` and `dead-code` are already blocking through the parent matrix.
- `dupes` and `health` are measured advisory lanes, not zero-debt lanes.
- Duplication enforcement starts with `quality:reuse-clones`, backed by
  `standards/clone.inventory.jsonc`, rather than raw Fallow dupes promotion.
- `boundaries` must stay split between generated config freshness and
  architecture legality.
- Generated boundary config freshness is wired through
  `repo-sanity:fallow-boundaries-config`.
- Fallow is an enforcement projection. Architecture meaning remains in
  canonical architecture standards and package READMEs.
- Knip stays in place.
- Non-dry-run `fallow fix` stays forbidden.
