/**
 * Side-effect-only stdout guard prelude for the IPC sidecar transport.
 *
 * `server/main.ts` imports this first, so the stdout diversion below runs before
 * the effect runtime, the `@beep/*` deps, or their transitive imports can evaluate.
 * Its only import is `effect/Predicate` — a pure leaf module that performs no I/O on
 * load — so nothing writes to stdout before the patch is installed. In IPC mode the
 * sidecar's stdout is the ndjson rpc frame stream the Tauri Rust shell parses, so any
 * stray byte written to stdout during module initialization would corrupt framing;
 * routing every non-protocol sink to stderr up front keeps stdout clean.
 *
 * The real (unpatched) stdout writer is captured and re-exported (via `protocolStdout`)
 * so the protocol sink in `IpcStdoutGuard.ts` can still reach fd 1 deliberately.
 *
 * Known limitation: this guards the realistic sinks (`console.*`,
 * `process.stdout.write`, `Bun.write` targeting `Bun.stdout`) but not raw
 * file-descriptor writes (for example `fs.writeSync(1, …)`). The sidecar IPC stdio
 * integration test asserts stdout stays a clean frame stream as a regression net.
