/**
 * App-local Tauri-IPC transport for the desktop chat sidecar (transport spike).
 *
 * Builds an Effect {@link Socket} whose inbound frames arrive on the Rust shell's
 * `sidecar://rx` event channel (the sidecar's stdout, bridged in
 * `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`) and whose outbound frames are written to the sidecar's
 * stdin via the `sidecar_send` command. Tunnelling the existing ndjson rpc frames
 * over this socket lets `RpcClient.layerProtocolSocket` drive the same
 * {@link ChatRpcs} contract the HTTP transport uses — with no loopback HTTP, no
 * `:3939`, and no CSP `connect-src` carve-out.
 *
 * Inbound frames are modelled as an Effect {@link Stream} fed by the two Tauri
 * `listen` channels; the listeners are torn down through {@link Scope} finalizers
 * rather than manual teardown. The Tauri Promise/callback boundary (`invoke`,
 * `listen`) is lifted into Effect with `Effect.tryPromise`, so the transport
 * logic itself stays free of bare Promise chains. Inbound payloads and the
 * sidecar-closed payload are decoded with `effect/Schema` at the boundary.
 *
 * This is the ONLY module that imports `@tauri-apps/api`; keeping the framework
 * wrapper app-local preserves the rule that shared clients/drivers stay
 * browser-safe (see `standards/architecture/03-driver-boundaries.md`).
