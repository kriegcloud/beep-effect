/**
 * Chat composer: a feature-flagged rich-text surface that sends or
 * edit-regenerates an assistant turn.
 *
 * Wraps `@beep/editor`'s {@link ChatComposer} (toolbar, `/` slash, `@` mentions,
 * attachment capture, plain-Enter-to-send, character count, send/stop) and
 * injects the product meaning: the formatting/insert slash items, a workspace
 * mention source, and the send/attachment wiring. The foundation owns the
 * mechanism; this file owns the meaning.
 *
 * The composer surfaces content via `onSerializedChange`; the latest serialized
 * state is held in a per-thread atom and the persisted draft is mirrored into
 * {@link draftAtoms} on every change. Loading a draft or an {@link editTargetAtom}
 * content is done by recomputing `initialState` and remounting via a changing
 * `key`. On submit the state is projected to a `@beep/md` document via
 * {@link editorStateToDocument} and dispatched through {@link runTurnAtom} as a
 * {@link SendTurnRequest} (new message) or {@link EditTurnRequest} (edit target).
 * Plain Enter sends (the foundation `SendPlugin`); Stop interrupts the turn fiber.
 *
