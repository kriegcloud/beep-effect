/**
 * Shared document → serialized-editor-state projection atom.

 * Projects an `@beep/md` {@link Md.Document} into a `@beep/lexical-schema`
 * serialized editor state through a single `Atom.runtime` family (no
 * `Effect.runSyncExit` in component code per the repo atom-first law). The codec
 * is pure, so the backing effect resolves synchronously on first read — the
 * `AsyncResult` is `Success` immediately, with a codec failure surfacing as an
 * `AsyncResult.Failure`. Reused by `MessageView` (read-only render) and the
 * `Composer` (editor seed) so the projection lives in one place.
