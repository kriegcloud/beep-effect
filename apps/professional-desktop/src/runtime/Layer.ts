/**
 * App-local live runtime Layer for the desktop chat surface.
 *
 * SPEC (increment 6b-3): assemble the already-built chat pieces into a single
 * runnable Layer the bun sidecar launches. {@link ChatHandlersLive} (the
 * `ChatRpcs` handler group) requires an {@link AgentTurnKernel}, a
 * {@link Thread.ThreadStore}, and a {@link UsageRecordSink}; this module
 * provides all three:
 *
 * - **AgentTurnKernel** — {@link AnthropicTurnKernel} by default, or the
 *   deterministic keyless {@link FixtureTurnKernel} when `CHAT_AGENT=fixture`.
 *   Both are self-contained `Layer<AgentTurnKernel>`.
 * - **ThreadStore** — the Drizzle-backed {@link Thread.ThreadStoreDrizzleLayer}
 *   over the shared PGlite {@link PostgresDrizzle}.
 * - **UsageRecordSink** — the Drizzle-backed {@link UsageRecordSinkDrizzle} over
 *   the same shared {@link PostgresDrizzle}.
 *
 * The ThreadStore and usage sink share one PGlite-backed
 * {@link PgliteDrizzleLive} database (migrations applied on boot); observability
 * is env-gated. The composed {@link RuntimeLive} resolves the handler group's
 * three requirements to `never`, so the sidecar only has to add the rpc/http
 * transport on top.
 *
 * A {@link RuntimeTest} variant (fixture kernel + in-memory store + in-memory
 * sink, no database, no key) is provided for smoke/dev.
