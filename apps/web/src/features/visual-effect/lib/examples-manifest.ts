//     "error handling": `**Error Handling** in Effect is **type-safe** and **composable**. Effects track potential errors at the type level, enabling precise error recovery and handling strategies.

// Effect provides powerful tools like **catchAll**, **catchTag**, **retry**, and **either** to handle different failure scenarios. Errors are tracked as union types, ensuring you know exactly what can go wrong and handle it appropriately.`,

//     schedule: `**Scheduling** enables **repeating** and **retrying** effects with sophisticated timing control. Schedules are composable patterns that define when and how often effects should execute.

// Use schedules to implement **retry policies** for resilient error handling, **repetition patterns** for recurring tasks, and **complex timing behaviors** by combining simple schedules into sophisticated recurrence patterns.`,

//     ref: `**Refs** are Effect's solution for **state management** in concurrent applications. They enable safe communication and shared state between different fibers in your program.

// Unlike regular variables, refs provide **controlled state updates** that work safely across concurrent operations, ensuring consistency even when multiple fibers access the same state simultaneously.`,

//     scope: `**Scopes** represent the **lifetime of resources** and ensure efficient cleanup and safe resource handling. They manage a stack of **finalizers** that define how to release resources.

// The key guarantee is that finalizers are executed **no matter what** — whether the effect succeeds, fails, dies, or is interrupted.`,
