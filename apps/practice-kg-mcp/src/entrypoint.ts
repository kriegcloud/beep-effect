 * Run a practice KG executable through the shared Bun service boundary when its module is the process entrypoint.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * With `logger`, the program runs under that logger layer and an unreported
 * failure is logged through it instead of through the runtime's default
 * report, which writes to stdout.
 *
 * **Example** (Run a program when the module is the entrypoint)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { runEntrypoint } from "../../src/entrypoint.ts"
 * import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";
 * runEntrypoint({ isMain: false, program: Effect.void })
 * ```
 *
 * @param input - Entrypoint status, Effect program and optional logger layer.
 * @category utilities
