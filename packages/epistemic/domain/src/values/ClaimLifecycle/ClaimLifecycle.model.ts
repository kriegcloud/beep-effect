/**
 * Claim lifecycle value schemas.

 * The claim admission lifecycle vocabulary is shared-kernel product language
 * owned by `@beep/shared-domain` (promoted 2026-06-18). The epistemic slice owns
 * the *mechanism* — the SHACL claim gate, the transition service, and the
 * projection — while the *vocabulary* (`ClaimLifecycle`, `ClaimLifecycleTransition`)
 * lives in shared so other verticals can type against it without importing the
 * epistemic slice's domain. This module re-exports the shared vocabulary to
 * preserve the `@beep/epistemic-domain` public surface.
