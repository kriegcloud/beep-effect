 * pass can report each stretch's visible strokes separately), from which the
 * kernel counts the view's coverage. With `regions` (graded shading after
 * the probe pass: the chains of overlapping visible pieces of each face),
 * each face's visible stretches are shaded one by one.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * Broken-line parts never reach this pass: the kernel shades the solid
 * compound only. Faces of solid parts that only broken primitives own
 * (`isBrokenFace`) are skipped with reason `broken-part` before the rules
 * run, so they get no lines and are counted under that reason. A face
 * merged across a solid and a broken primitive is shaded as one face, and
 * `claimedOf` cuts each of its strokes back to the part on the solid
 * primitive. `viewedLength` is the kernel's measure of a planned stroke on
 * the view plane: a graded stretch whose tapered strokes leave no room for a
 * band by that measure is re-planned or drawn untapered before the kernel
 * reads it. A stretch drawn tapered also carries the same band as whole
 * clipped chords (`untapered`), made only on request: the kernel draws them
 * where hidden-line removal and the legibility pass leave the tapered band
 * fewer than two strokes, since a part in front can cut a probe row's cell
 * anywhere between the row and its unseen neighbour. Each of those strokes
 * carries its line's planned extent and rank, so the kernel cuts the redrawn
 * band back to its taper.
 *
 * `rooms` gives the room the kernel measured across a visible area of a face
 * (by face and by the area's index among the face's regions). It is a rescue
 * only: an area whose ordinary plan leaves it without a band (a `narrow` or
 * sliver skip, or lines without room) is planned again with each band
 * position judged by what the view shows rather than by the face's whole
 * chord, its strokes drawn over the area's whole range (review loop 4,
 * G-01). An area the ordinary plan bands keeps that band, each stroke
 * clipped to its own rows' cells (review loop 4, R4-08). Every visible
 * stretch that hands no strokes over is reported in `skipped` with its
 * reason and whether its measured room fits a band (review loop 4, A-01).
 *
 * `neighbours` are the pairs of faces that share an edge visible in the view.
 * A face turned toward the light must never carry more ink than a darker face
 * it shares such an edge with (review loop 3, O-02): the bands are settled by
 * `settleBandTapers`, which cuts the lighter band back to the lit taper and
 * then to the lit floor while it out-inks its neighbour, and only a face whose
 * taper changes is shaded again. Banded faces of one seen area a tone step
 * apart (`inkTwins`) are settled the same way, shared edge or not (review
 * loop 4, F11-04). With no neighbours and no twins every band is the band its
 * own tone gives.
 *
 * `groupBeyond` is the kernel's reading beside a band's first line of the
 * drawn lines just beyond the band's edge. A band whose edge has lines
 * running alongside it within the plan's ladder reach is planned again with
 * its first line behind the gutter `bandLead` gives (review loop 3, O-04), so
 * band, edge, and lines never read as one evenly spaced ladder. A gutter
