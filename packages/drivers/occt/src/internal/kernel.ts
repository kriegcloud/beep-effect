/**
 * Run exact hidden-line removal for one camera and return canonical segments.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * The solid compound, the broken-line compound, the shading strokes, and the
 * overlay lines facing this camera are added to one hidden-line pass, so
 * every part hides what lies behind it whatever its style; the solid
 * compound's visible (and, on request, hidden) edges, the broken compound's
 * visible edges, each stroke set's visible pieces, and each overlay's visible
 * pieces are then read on their own. Broken overlay pieces join the broken
 * layer and emphasis pieces the emphasis layer; overlays draw nothing else,
 * so a model without overlays projects exactly as before they existed. When
 * a solid part has unclaimed matter (broken add primitives), each piece of
 * the solid compound's outline is traced back to the parts' own edges and
 * silhouettes and split where it turns unclaimed: a visible unclaimed run
 * joins the broken layer and a hidden one is dropped, and at a point where
 * several edges project, a visible piece takes the style of the nearest. A
 * face only broken primitives own is never shaded (skipped as
 * `broken-part`), and the strokes on a face merged across both kinds keep to
 * its claimed part. Without unclaimed matter nothing changes. Graded
 * shading takes two passes: a probe across every graded face at several
 * heights goes through hidden-line removal first, as a shape of its own, and
 * its visible pieces give the face's visible stretches; the strokes are then
 * planned per stretch and projected with the outlines. A visible stretch
 * that fewer than three probe rows saw has its room for a stroke measured
 * first, by chords along the face's lines through one more hidden-line pass
 * that runs only when such a stretch exists, so its band goes where the view
 * shows enough of the face for a stroke. A stretch left with fewer than two
 * legible strokes carries none, and a face whose every stroke is lost is
 * counted in the coverage. A tapered band that hidden-line removal and the
 * legibility pass leave with fewer than two strokes (a part in front cut its
 * probe row's cell short) is drawn again on its whole clipped chords in a
 * further pass, which runs only when such a band exists; it is counted lost
 * only when those draw nothing either. A band drawn on whole chords, by that
 * pass or by the planner, is cut back to its taper on what shows, and its
 * face's ink is read again against its darker neighbours: a face that out-inks
 * one has the band stepped to the lit floor, or left bare as a planned skip. A
 * face whose every planned stretch has room for fewer than two legible strokes
 * draws nothing by design and is counted a sliver, not a shaded face. Every
 * visible stretch skipped by design is counted with its reason and whether its
 * measured room fits a band. The uniform style keeps one pass. The drawn
 * strokes come in one canonical order, with one band per stretch that drew
 * ink naming its face and its strokes' places in that order.
