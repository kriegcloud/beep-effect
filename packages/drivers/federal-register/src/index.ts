 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { VERSION } from "@beep/federal-register"
 *
 * const packageLabel = `@beep/federal-register@${VERSION}`
 * console.log(packageLabel) // "@beep/federal-register@0.0.0"
 * ```

 * @packageDocumentation
 * @since 0.0.0

/**
 * Package version for the Federal Register driver package.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This is the package release marker, not a Federal Register API version,
 * publication date, document number, or edition identifier. Model upstream
 * Federal Register versioning separately when endpoint modules are added.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { VERSION } from "@beep/federal-register"
 *
 * const isInitialPackageVersion = VERSION === "0.0.0"
 * console.log(isInitialPackageVersion) // true
 * ```
