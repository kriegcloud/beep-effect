# @beep/rdf-canonize

Driver package for RDF Dataset Canonicalization using the external
`rdf-canonize` implementation.

The service contract remains in `@beep/semantic-web/services/canonicalization`.
RDF value models come from `@beep/rdf`. This package owns the third-party
adapter, resource limits, and canonicalization security tests.

## Surface

  const service = yield* CanonicalizationService
  return service
})

console.log(program.pipe(Effect.provide(canonicalization.CanonicalizationServiceLive)))
```
