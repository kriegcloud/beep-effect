 * The public surface combines schema-first request/error models with an Effect
 * service boundary. Domain packages own SQL shape, retention policy, and
 * projection semantics; this package owns native DuckDB connection management,
 * typed error normalization, transaction mechanics, and Parquet export wiring.
