 * What the side whose `configDependencies` are being replayed recorded beyond

 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * Both fields are optional, and omitting the whole context is always valid:
 * nothing here changes which version is replayed. `lockfile` matters only when
 * a replaying layer must fetch a version installed nowhere, and only
 * `ConfigDependencyHooks.layerSubprocess` fetches. Without it, a bare
 * `configDependencies` spec has no integrity to verify a fetch against, so the
 * fetch fails closed with `reason: "integrityUnavailable"`.
 *
 * `WorkspaceCatalogs` passes the working tree's lockfile, and
 * `WorkspaceSnapshots.at(ref)` passes the lockfile and the ref it read at, so
 * each side of a diff is verified against its own record.
 *
 * **Example** (Record the declaring git ref)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { HookReplayContext } from "@beep/repo-workspaces/ConfigDependencyReplay";
 *
 * const context = HookReplayContext.make({ ref: "origin/main" });
 * console.log(context.ref) // origin/main
