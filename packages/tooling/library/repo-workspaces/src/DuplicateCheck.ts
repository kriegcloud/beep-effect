// Duplicate-resolution detection over a parsed lockfile — a pure VALUE, not a
// service. No IO, nothing in `R`, no error channel. PeerCheck's sibling, on
// the same posture: format-free, over `@effected/lockfiles`' normalized
// instances, walking `resolved` edges from each importer's roots.
//
// The question it answers is the one issue #298 could not get from a type
// error and issue #603 could not get without looping `pnpm why` by hand:
// "which names resolve at more than one version, and who pulls each copy?"
// The answer is provenance plus a diff-able version list, not a boolean — a
// duplicate is harmless while the copies' shapes agree, and what makes them
// disagree is a stale transitive inside one copy, so the dependent that holds
// each copy is the actionable part.
//
// `instanceId` is OPAQUE here — looked up, never parsed. Splitting one on "@"
// or "(" would re-introduce the format knowledge this module exists without.
