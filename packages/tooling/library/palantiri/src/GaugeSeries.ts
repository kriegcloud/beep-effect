/**
 * Set one series per reading, then drop every other series of the gauge from
 * the current metric registry.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * A gauge keeps its last value, so a series whose reading went stale would
 * otherwise keep exporting it for the life of the process. The registry is
 * the `Map` Effect defines for `Metric.MetricRegistry` (Effect ships no
 * remove-series API); deleting an entry is how a series leaves the next
 * `Metric.snapshot`, which is what the OTLP exporter reads. Effect 4.0.4
 * stores a series under the gauge's own attributes, overlaid by the ambient
 * `Metric.CurrentMetricAttributes`, overlaid by the `withAttributes` set
 * (`Metric.ts` `hook` and `addAttributesToContext`), so the kept set is built
 * with that same merge. The new series are written before the old ones are
 * dropped, so a concurrent export never sees a fresh series missing. An empty
 * reading list clears the gauge.
 *
 * **Example** (Keep only the fresh provider's series)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { replaceGaugeSeries } from "@beep/palantiri"
 * import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"
 * import * as Metric from "effect/Metric"
 *
 * const remaining = Metric.gauge("beep.example.remaining")
 * const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   yield* replaceGaugeSeries(remaining, [[{ "beep.provider": "anthropic" }, 60], [{ "beep.provider": "openai" }, 40]])
 *   yield* replaceGaugeSeries(remaining, [[{ "beep.provider": "anthropic" }, 55]])
 *   return yield* Metric.snapshot
 * })
 * const series = Effect.runSync(Effect.provideService(program, Metric.MetricRegistry, new Map()))
 * console.log(series.map((metric) => metric.attributes?.["beep.provider"])) // ["anthropic"]
 * ```
 *
 * @param gauge - The gauge whose series set is replaced.
 * @param readings - One attribute set and value per series to keep.
 * @returns An effect that writes the readings and removes every other series of the gauge.
