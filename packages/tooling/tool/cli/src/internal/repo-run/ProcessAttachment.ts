/**
 * Enumerate the same-uid processes attached to a directory tree through `/proc`.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * The directory is resolved through realPath before comparison because the
 * kernel fully resolves `/proc` link targets, so a symlinked ancestor would
 * otherwise hide every attachment. Unreadable pids are dropped, never treated
 * as attached: every host permanently carries pids whose links are unreadable
 * by construction — foreign uids and this user's own ptrace-protected
 * processes (systemd --user, sd-pam, the compositor, gpg-agent, every
 * 1Password op) — so a fail-closed rule for them would wedge every scan and
 * make retirement unreachable. The guarded population (this user's agent
 * processes) is dumpable and observable, and the one protected kind that
 * plausibly occupies a checkout, an op-run wrapper, spawns dumpable children
 * that expose the same cwd. Only a failure to list `/proc` or to resolve the
 * directory withholds the result. Reading descriptors visits every
 * `/proc/<pid>/fd` link, which is the thorough form a destructive step wants;
 * a cwd-only scan is the cheap form a liveness probe repeats per candidate.
 * A `watch` scan reports a process whose inotify watches include the
 * directory itself (matched by {@link inotifyWatchTarget}; a watch on a
 * subdirectory alone is not reported). It names watchers rather than
 * proving anything, so a directory whose inotify identity cannot be read
 * yields no watch attachments instead of withholding the result.
 * The table is read through the `ProcessTable` reference, so a test can
 * substitute a scripted one.
 *
 * **Example** (Find the invoking process through its cwd)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { scanProcessAttachments } from "@beep/repo-cli/test/RepoRun"
 * import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"

 * const scan = scanProcessAttachments({ directory: process.cwd(), kinds: ["cwd"] })
