/**
 * Target-filesystem atomic-exchange capability for native configuration writes.

 * the target's parent directory, together with the filesystem type when the
 * host reports one, and caches one probe result per identity.
 *
 * Every publication the writer makes is a durable state machine in its journal:
 * the forward steps, the recovery states and the paths, hashes and filesystem
 * identity that restart recovery reconciles from.

 * Why a target filesystem cannot exchange two pathnames atomically.

 * that is itself a mount point), `einval` (the filesystem does not implement
 * the flag), `eperm` (the filesystem or a security module forbids it) and
