# `@beep/repo-cli`

CLI tool for creating and managing packages in the beep-effect monorepo following Effect v4 standards.

## Requirements

- **TypeScript 5.9 or Newer**
- **Strict Type-Checking**
- **Bun 1.3.9 or Newer**

## Installation

This is a private workspace package. Use it via:

```bash
bunx @beep/repo-cli <command>
```

## Command Topology

`@beep/repo-cli` uses thresholded command topology. Tiny leaf commands can stay
flat while they have no schemas, services, renderers, or subcommands. Command
groups and role-bearing commands live in `commands/<Group>/`.

Canonical group roles:

- `<Group>.command.ts`: flags, arguments, `Command.make`, and adapter glue.
- `<Group>.schemas.ts`: command option, result, report, and manifest schemas.
- `<Group>.errors.ts`: one exported `<Group>CommandError` for command-boundary
  failures.
- `<Group>.service.ts`: `Context.Service` contract, constructor, and default
  live layer.
- `<Group>.render.ts`: pure human or JSON output rendering when output is
  non-trivial.
- `index.ts`: curated public facade for the command, public schemas/types,
  command error, and service contract.

Optional roles are earned by complexity. Prefer semantic names such as
`<Group>.progress.ts`, `<Group>.paths.ts`, `<Group>.media.ts`, or
`<Group>.plan.ts`; do not add new `<Group>.utils.ts` modules. Use
`<Group>.config.ts` only for typed runtime configuration backed by
`Config`/`ConfigProvider`, and add `<Group>.layer.ts` only for multiple or
non-trivial layer variants.

Command-owned private roles belong under `commands/<Group>/internal/`.
Package-wide shared CLI support belongs under `src/internal/cli/`, not a
package-local `foundation/` directory. Keep command services free of final
terminal rendering: services return typed results/reports, command adapters
render output and choose process-visible failure semantics.

Public imports are explicit: use `@beep/repo-cli` or
`@beep/repo-cli/commands/<Group>`. Deep role files are private. Package tests
that need internal seams use source-only `@beep/repo-cli/test/<Group>` aliases;
those aliases are not package exports.

## Commands

### `architecture`

Create and verify canonical architecture parts through a schema-versioned
operation plan.

```bash
bun run beep architecture plan > /tmp/architecture-plan.json
bun run beep architecture check --file /tmp/architecture-plan.json
bun run beep architecture apply --file /tmp/architecture-plan.json
```

Ergonomic wrappers write by default and expose the same JSON plan with
`--dry-run`:

```bash
bun run beep architecture create slice architecture-lab WorkItem --stage core --dry-run
bun run beep architecture create package research-lab domain --dry-run
bun run beep architecture add concept architecture-lab WorkItem --stage persistence --dry-run
bun run beep architecture add role architecture-lab WorkItem server --stage full --dry-run
bun run beep architecture add concept architecture-lab Worker --domain-kind entities --stage persistence --dry-run
bun run beep architecture add concept architecture-lab WorkPriority --domain-kind values --stage core --dry-run
```

The factory is core-first: `create slice` defaults to domain, use-cases, and
server. Add config, tables, protocol handlers, client, UI, proof-app, and
db-admin targets through explicit stages or role commands.

`create package` is the architecture-native package shell command for normal
slice roles. It supports `domain`, `use-cases`, `config`, `server`, `tables`,
`client`, and `ui`, and intentionally does not create concept modules. Use
`add concept` or `add role` for concept-qualified files after the role package
exists. The older top-level `create-package` command remains a compatibility
surface for non-architecture scaffolding.

Supported domain-kind archetypes are:

- `aggregates`: full canonical slice topology, proven by
  `aggregates/WorkItem`.
- `entities`: persisted domain entity topology through use-cases, server,
  tables, and db-admin migration files, proven by `entities/Worker`.
- `values`: domain-only value-object topology, proven by
  `values/WorkPriority`.

The JSON operation-plan schema stays `architecture-operation-plan/v1`; domain
kind changes select different accepted proof files and reject roles that do not
belong to that archetype.

### `create-package`

Create a new package or app workspace following repo topology rules.

```bash
bunx @beep/repo-cli create-package <name> [--type=library|tool]
bunx @beep/repo-cli create-package <name> --type=app --app-kind=nextjs
bunx @beep/repo-cli create-package <name> --type=app --app-kind=tauri
bunx @beep/repo-cli create-package <name> --type=app --app-kind=runtime-proof
```

`--type app` requires `--app-kind`. `nextjs` and `tauri` generate framework
apps without a public `@beep/<app>` TypeScript package API: no `src/index.ts`,
package exports, docgen, dtslint, or type-test script. Use app-local `@/*`
imports for tests and internal modules. `runtime-proof` is the explicit
exception for app workspaces that intentionally prove runtime package contracts;
it keeps the package-like scaffold.

### `codegen`

Generate barrel file exports for a package.

```bash
bunx @beep/repo-cli codegen [package-dir]
```

### `quality package-verify`

Run package-local `beep:lint`, `beep:check`, and `beep:test` scripts in
parallel for a single workspace package. `--quick` runs lint and check only.
When no package argument is provided, the command uses the current Git working
tree to auto-detect exactly one changed package.

```bash
bun run beep quality package-verify @beep/repo-cli
bun run beep quality package-verify --quick @beep/repo-cli
bun run pkg:verify @beep/repo-cli
bun run pkg:verify:quick @beep/repo-cli
```

The root `pkg:verify` aliases point at this command; their implementation lives
inside `@beep/repo-cli`, not in repository-level scripts.

### Root Quality Aliases

Root quality scripts such as `lint`, `lint:fix`, `check`, `test`, `build`, and
`audit` are thin aliases into `beep-cli`. The `lint:fix` alias uses
`beep-cli lint --fix`; for an unscoped clean working tree it exits before the
full command tree loads, and for changed files it applies Biome only to the
changed file set. Use `bun run lint:fix --full` or `bun run lint:fix --repo`
when the aggregate Turbo `lint:fix` lane is required. Root lint Turbo lanes add
`--concurrency=3` by default to avoid saturating local machines with many
parallel package-level Biome workers; pass an explicit `--concurrency` value
when a different bound is needed.

Use `bun run beep lint policy` for the repo-wide policy gates without the
aggregate Turbo lint lane. It runs the law, allowlist, schema/reflection,
docgen, spelling, circularity, tagged-error, clone, and typos checks that must
stay advisory-free locally and in CI.

### `docgen quality`

Produce a report-only JSDoc quality review for exported symbols. The command
does not block on advisory findings; use `--score codex` when you want bounded
remediation packets for follow-up documentation work. Package-local runs write
`JSDOC_QUALITY.md` or `JSDOC_QUALITY.json` by default; use `--output` for a
scratch destination. Reports use schema v2 package status fields, so a
time-bounded package can appear as `partial` without discarding the rest of the
run. Codex packets are ranked and capped at 25 per run by default; use
`--packet-limit` to widen the work queue or `--packet-limit 0` to suppress it.

```bash
bun run beep docgen quality -p packages/shared/domain -o /tmp/jsdoc-quality.md
bun run beep docgen quality --changed-files --json
bun run beep docgen quality --all --score codex --packet-limit 25 -o /tmp/jsdoc-quality.json
```

### `ai-metrics`

Run repo-local AI-agent analytics workflows for transcript ingest, Phoenix
install proofs, OTLP export, benchmark scoring, labeling, reports, and P7
operator workflows.

The P7 mirror commands build and inspect sanitized derived mirror bundles. A
sync is a dry-run by default and requires `--confirm p7-derived-mirror` before
it writes to the remote mirror root.

```bash
bun run beep ai-metrics mirror build --target dankserver --data-root .beep/ai-metrics --json
bun run beep ai-metrics mirror sync --bundle latest --json
bun run beep ai-metrics mirror status --json
```

The P7 retention commands are local-first. `list` and `restore-drill` are proof
workflows; `delete` and `compact` are dry-run previews unless the command also
has an explicit retention window and `--confirm p7-retention-window`.

```bash
bun run beep ai-metrics retention list --data-root .beep/ai-metrics --json
bun run beep ai-metrics retention restore-drill --data-root .beep/ai-metrics --restore-root /tmp/ai-metrics-restore --before 2026-05-16T00:00:00Z --json
bun run beep ai-metrics retention delete --data-root .beep/ai-metrics --before 2026-05-16T00:00:00Z --json
bun run beep ai-metrics retention compact --data-root .beep/ai-metrics --before 2026-05-16T00:00:00Z --json
```

### `files`

Curate direct image and video files for dataset preparation. From the repo root,
prefer the workspace shortcut:

```bash
bun run files <subcommand> [options]
```

The package binary works the same way:

```bash
bunx @beep/repo-cli files <subcommand> [options]
```

All `files` subcommands work on direct children of `--dir`; they do not recurse
into nested directories.

#### `files sort-and-rename`

Sort direct files by size, largest first, then rename them with a generated
prefix and zero-padded index.

```bash
bun run files sort-and-rename --dir ./tmp --prefix image --dry-run
bun run files sort-and-rename --dir ./tmp --prefix image
```

Output names use `<prefix>_<index>.<ext>`. The index width grows with the number
of selected files, so 7 files use `00`, 50 files use `000`, and 100 files use
`0000`.

Use `--with-dimensions` to append probed media dimensions:

```bash
bun run files sort-and-rename --dir ./tmp --prefix image --with-dimensions
```

With dimensions enabled, names use
`<prefix>_<index>_<width>x<height>.<ext>`, for example
`image_00_1024x1536.png`. Non-media files are left untouched. Video dimensions
require `ffprobe`.

#### `files strip-metadata`

Strip metadata from direct image and video files in place.

```bash
bun run files strip-metadata --dir ./dataset/images --dry-run
bun run files strip-metadata --dir ./dataset/images
```

Images are normalized through `sharp`; videos are rewritten through `ffmpeg`.
This command rewrites selected files in place, so run with `--dry-run` first
when working on irreplaceable sources.

#### `files normalize`

Normalize direct image files into a separate output directory and write a
transform manifest.

```bash
bun run files normalize \
  --dir ./raw \
  --out-dir ./dataset/images \
  --format png \
  --max-long-edge 1024
```

`normalize` applies EXIF orientation, strips metadata, converts format, and can
downscale the long edge without upscaling smaller images. Supported output
formats are `png`, `jpg`/`jpeg`, and `webp`; `png` is the default. The command
preserves source stems (`foo.jpg -> foo.png`) and resolves same-run collisions
as `foo.png`, `foo_01.png`, `foo_02.png`.

Useful options:

- `--manifest <path>` writes the manifest somewhere other than
  `--out-dir/normalize-manifest.json`.
- `--overwrite` allows replacing existing outputs, duplicate move targets, and
  the manifest.
- `--dry-run` prints the plan without creating directories or writing files.
- `--dedupe` skips later files whose normalized output bytes exactly duplicate
  an earlier output.
- `--move-duplicates-to <dir>` enables exact-byte dedupe and moves duplicate
  source files into the provided directory.

The manifest has schema version `beep.files.normalize.v1` and records source
paths, output paths, byte sizes, dimensions, hashes, skipped sources, duplicate
relationships, and summary counts.

#### `files create-captions`

Create same-stem `.txt` caption sidecar files for direct image files.

```bash
bun run files create-captions --dir ./dataset/images --dry-run
bun run files create-captions --dir ./dataset/images
```

By default, existing caption files are preserved and skipped. Use `--caption` to
seed newly created sidecars with shared text, such as a trigger token or class
phrase:

```bash
bun run files create-captions \
  --dir ./dataset/images \
  --caption "my_character, person"
```

Use `--overwrite` only when you intentionally want to replace existing caption
files with the provided `--caption` text, or with empty files when `--caption` is
omitted.

#### `files archive-poor-candidates`

Move obvious poor image candidates out of a dataset directory and write an
archive manifest.

```bash
bun run files archive-poor-candidates \
  --dir ./dataset/images \
  --archive-dir ./dataset/rejected \
  --dry-run
```

By default, the `character-lora` profile archives images that fail any of these
thresholds:

- shorter edge below `--min-short-edge` (`512` by default)
- aspect ratio above `--max-aspect` (`3` by default)
- estimated upscale to `--target-resolution` square area above `--max-upscale`
  (`1024` target resolution and `1.5` max upscale by default)

Same-stem `.txt` sidecars move with archived images by default. Use
`--sidecars none` to leave sidecars in place, or pass a comma-separated list such
as `--sidecars txt,json`. The manifest defaults to
`--archive-dir/archive-poor-candidates-manifest.json`; use `--manifest` to
choose another path and `--overwrite` to replace existing archive targets or the
manifest.

#### `files detect-borders`

Detect solid or near-solid canvas borders in direct image files.

```bash
bun run files detect-borders --dir ./dataset/images
bun run files detect-borders --dir ./dataset/images --json
```

Tune detection with:

- `--tolerance` maximum RGB channel distance from the sampled edge color
  (`12` by default)
- `--min-solid-pct` minimum matching pixels in a border row or column
  (`98.5` by default)
- `--min-width-pct` minimum detected border width (`1` by default)
- `--max-scan-pct` maximum percent of each dimension to scan from an edge
  (`45` by default)

`--json` emits a `beep.files.detect-borders.v1` report.

#### `files crop-borders`

Crop detected solid or near-solid borders from direct image files in place.

```bash
bun run files crop-borders --dir ./dataset/images --dry-run
bun run files crop-borders --dir ./dataset/images
```

`crop-borders` uses the same tuning flags as `detect-borders`. It rewrites
selected images in place, so use `--dry-run` before applying crops to a dataset.

### `image`

Curate videos for image datasets.

```bash
bun run beep image extract-frames --video ./clip.mp4 --out-dir ./frames --fps 1
bun run beep image extract-frames-dir --dir ./videos --fps 1
```

`extract-frames` writes PNG frames plus
`extract-frames-manifest.json` by default. Use `--manifest` to choose another
manifest path, `--prefix` to override the generated frame prefix, and
`--overwrite` to replace existing outputs.

`extract-frames-dir` processes direct video files only. Each source writes to a
sibling directory named after its stem, and same-stem videos fail during
preflight before extraction begins.

### `sync-data-to-ts`

Sync checked-in generated TypeScript data modules from official upstream sources.

```bash
bunx @beep/repo-cli sync-data-to-ts --target iso4217
bunx @beep/repo-cli sync-data-to-ts --all
bunx @beep/repo-cli sync-data-to-ts --all --check
```

### `docs`

Discover repository laws, skills, and policy gates through command-first output.

```bash
bunx @beep/repo-cli docs laws
bunx @beep/repo-cli docs skills
bunx @beep/repo-cli docs policies
bunx @beep/repo-cli docs find <topic>
```

### `quality`

Run repository operational quality lanes that are not package-local Turbo tasks.

```bash
bun run beep quality github-checks quality
bun run beep quality github-checks repo-sanity
bun run beep quality bun-audit
bun run beep quality dtslint-tsgo
bun run beep quality test-tsgo
bun run beep quality tsgo-smoke
bun run beep quality tsgo-rules
bun run beep quality jsdoc-module-tags
bun run beep quality jsdoc-inventory
bun run beep quality changeset-graph
```

### `yeet`

Run the canonical End-to-End Green operator path: deterministic repair, full
local proof, reviewed commit, push, hosted PR check monitoring, and merge
readiness.

```bash
bun run beep yeet repair
bun run beep yeet verify
bun run beep yeet publish --message "type(scope): summary"
bun run beep yeet monitor
```

`repair` runs deterministic write steps: changed-file lint fixes, local docgen,
and affected feedback. Affected test feedback is scoped to unit and type-test
lanes; integration stays in the full proof. `verify` runs the canonical full
local `quality github-checks pre-push` proof without
duplicate affected feedback first. `publish` requires reviewed staged changes,
commits them, runs the same `pre-push` proof against the new local commit, and
pushes only after that proof passes. `monitor` watches hosted PR checks for the
current branch. Bare `yeet --message ...` remains a publish alias.

Use `--plan --json` on any mode to inspect the planned steps without running
them. `publish --fast --monitor` is an explicit PR-branch-only exception for
cases where hosted PR checks replace the local full pre-push wait; the normal
`publish --message` path remains the default. `bun run audit:github pre-push`
remains the named full local fallback for secrets, security, SAST, Nix, and
manual proof outside Yeet. If Yeet passes locally but the PR fails in GitHub
Actions, treat that as a Yeet/quality parity bug or environment drift unless
the failure is clearly an external outage.

### `ci`

Render CI helper output from checked-in repo automation.

```bash
bun run beep ci append-turbo-summary
bun run beep ci append-turbo-summary .turbo/runs/latest.json
```

### `graphiti`

Run and manage the local Graphiti MCP queue proxy.

```bash
bun run beep graphiti proxy
bun run beep graphiti proxy ensure
bun run beep graphiti proxy service install
bun run beep graphiti restore --dry-run
bun run beep graphiti restore
bun run beep graphiti verify
bun run beep graphiti recover --dry-run
```

### `codex`

Launch Codex helper workflows from repo-owned prompts.

```bash
bun run beep codex quality-review-fix-loop "close the current initiative"
```
