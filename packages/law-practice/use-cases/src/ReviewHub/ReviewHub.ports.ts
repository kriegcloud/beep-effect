 * code, so a tool can return the failure as it is. Only `openItems` reads;
 * the other three append one row.
 *
 * **Example** (Name a hub operation)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import type { ReviewHubShape } from "@beep/law-practice-use-cases/ReviewHub"
 *
 * const operation: keyof ReviewHubShape = "openItems"
 * console.log(operation) // "openItems"
