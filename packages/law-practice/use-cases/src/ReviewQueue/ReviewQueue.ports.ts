/**
 * Port shape: the append-only store behind the verdict log.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * The store has no policy: it does not compute revisions, check locks or
 * order rows by time. It appends what it is given and reads back every row in
 * append order. There is no update and no delete.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * The queue reads the log, checks the lock, then appends, and it serializes
 * those steps for its own writes within one process. Writers in separate
 * processes sharing one durable store can still both pass the lock check or
 * both compute the same revision, so only cross-process writers need
 * adapter-level serialization. Append-only rows mean such a race never loses
 * a verdict, only duplicates a revision number.
 *
 * **Example** (Name a store method)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import type { VerdictLogShape } from "@beep/law-practice-use-cases/ReviewQueue"
 *
 * const method: keyof VerdictLogShape = "append"
 * console.log(method) // "append"

/**
 * Service shape of the review queue.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * Every write appends a row through {@link VerdictLog}; nothing edits or
 * deletes one.
 *
 * - **Latest verdict.** An item's latest verdict is its row with the greatest
 *   `recordedAt` across every batch; ties go to the row appended last, since
 *   rows are read in append order. Revisions never break ties: they count per
 *   item within one batch, and a later revision is always appended later. A latest verdict of `right` or `wrong` is final; `partly`
 *   and `withdrawn` are not, and `withdrawn` leaves the item with no current
 *   judgement.
 * - **Revisions.** Revisions count per item within one batch. A verdict is
 *   recorded with one more than the highest revision of that item in that
 *   batch, or 1 when the batch has no row for the item.
 * - **Undo.** Undo is the attorney's next verdict for the same item in the
 *   same batch: it appends a superseding revision and the earlier row stays
 *   in the log.
 * - **Lock.** A batch is locked once any of its rows carries `lockedAt`.
 *   Locking appends a copy of the batch's latest row (greatest `recordedAt`,
 *   then append order) with `revision` one higher, the same `itemId`, `verdict`,
 *   `note` and `recordedAt`, and `lockedAt` read from the clock. Verdict
 *   selection skips lock rows, so locking never changes any item's verdict or
 *   projection, even when `recordedAt` ties across batches. After that every write to the batch, a second lock included,
 *   fails with `VerdictBatchLockedError`; a write under a new `batchId`
 *   succeeds.
 *
 * Timestamps come from the `Clock` service, so tests control them with
 * `TestClock`.
 *
 * **Example** (Name a queue method)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import type { ReviewQueueShape } from "@beep/law-practice-use-cases/ReviewQueue"

 * console.log(method) // "recordVerdict"
