 * Why a question write or its undo failed.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * - `calendar-unavailable`: the calendar could not be reached or answered
 *   with an error;
 * - `event-not-found`: the event a write updates or an undo restores no
 *   longer exists;
 * - `event-verified`: the attorney has verified the event a write would
 *   change (its docket category is no longer provisional), so the write is
 *   refused and the event left as it is;
 * - `restore-failed`: the calendar refused to put an event back, or a failed
 *   apply could not take back every write it had made.
 *
 * **Example** (Guard a write failure reason)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { QuestionWriteReason } from "@beep/law-practice-use-cases/QuestionWrites"
 *
 * console.log(QuestionWriteReason.is["event-not-found"]("event-not-found")) // true

 * A question write, or the undo of one, failed at the calendar.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * `itemId` names the question whose write failed when the failure belongs to
 * one. When a failed apply could not take back every write it had made, the
 * reason is `restore-failed`, `cause` is the error that stopped the apply, and
 * `pendingItemIds` names the questions whose writes may still be on the
 * calendar; the message names them too. The cause is kept for diagnostics.
 *
 * **Example** (Report a missing event)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { QuestionWriteError } from "@beep/law-practice-use-cases/QuestionWrites"
 * import * as O from "effect/Option"
 *
 * const error = QuestionWriteError.make({ reason: "event-not-found", itemId: O.some("question:1") })
