/**
 * Layer providing question writes over whichever {@link QuestionCalendar} the caller supplies.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * - `propose` is pure: for each question whose current answer is `decided`
 *   on an option that names a write, it returns one `ProposedWrite`, in the
 *   order of `items`.
 * - `apply` upserts each proposal under its {@link questionWriteKey}, in batch
 *   order, and returns the `AppliedWriteBatch` with each event's prior state.
 *   When a write fails, the writes already applied in that call are restored
 *   in reverse, each tried even if another fails. When all come back, the
 *   write's own failure is returned unchanged; when some do not, the failure
 *   is `restore-failed`, with the write's failure as `cause` and the
 *   questions still applied in `pendingItemIds`.
 * - `undo` restores every applied write, last applied first.
 *
 * **Example** (Provide the layer over a calendar)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { QuestionCalendar, QuestionWritesLive } from "@beep/law-practice-use-cases/QuestionWrites"
 * import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"
 * import * as Layer from "effect/Layer"
 * import * as O from "effect/Option"
 *
 * const calendar = Layer.succeed(QuestionCalendar, {
 *   upsert: () => Effect.succeed({ eventId: "evt-0001", prior: O.none() }),
 *   restore: () => Effect.void
 * })
 * console.log(Layer.isLayer(QuestionWritesLive.pipe(Layer.provide(calendar)))) // true
 * ```
