/**
 * Synthetic office-action fixture shared by the integration test.
 *
 * A small, self-contained office-action text carrying claim 1, a §102
 * anticipation rejection citing one prior-art reference (Smith), and a
 * distinguishing limitation. The distinguishing phrase appears in Title Case
 * (`"A Hinge Coupling The Lid To The Base"`) while the review loop's distinction
 * candidate is lower case, so deterministic alignment takes the case-insensitive
 * `match_lesser` path and the re-slice recovers the original-case substring.
 *
 * Well under the langextract caps (source < 100k, candidate < 4096). Local test
 * helper (not a `src` module).
