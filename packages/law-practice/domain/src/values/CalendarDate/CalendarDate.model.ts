/**
 * Calendar date value object: a day that exists in its month, encoded as an
 * ISO date string.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * `@beep/schema/LocalDate`'s `LocalDateFromString` encodes a `LocalDate` as
 * its ISO date string, the way docket-intake writes calendar dates. Its
 * decoder rejects a day the month does not have, but `LocalDate` itself only
 * range-checks the day, so a constructed or generated `LocalDate` can name
 * February 31. This composition adds that check on the decoded side too, so
 * every value it accepts encodes and decodes back to itself.

/**
 * A day that exists in its month, encoded as an ISO date string (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * The decoded value is a `LocalDate`. Decoding and construction both reject a
 * day past the end of its month, such as `2026-02-30`, so values generated
 * from this schema round-trip through its encoding.
 *
 * **Example** (Decode a calendar date)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { CalendarDate } from "@beep/law-practice-domain/values"
 * import * as S from "effect/Schema"
 *
 * console.log(S.decodeUnknownExit(CalendarDate)("2026-11-02")._tag) // "Success"
 * console.log(S.decodeUnknownExit(CalendarDate)("2026-02-30")._tag) // "Failure"
 * ```
