/**
 * One append-only entry in the attorney's answer log for a question, discriminated on `state`.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * Rows are never edited or deleted, and none is ever locked. The current
 * answer is the item's row with the greatest `recordedAt`; only a tie on
 * `recordedAt` goes to the row appended last, the same recency rule as
 * `VerdictRow`. A row appended later with an earlier `recordedAt` does not
 * revise the answer. `decided` requires the chosen `optionId` and
 * `pending-on-client` requires `resurfaceOn`. That the `optionId` names an
 * option of the item is checked against the item, not by this schema.
 * Timestamps encode as epoch milliseconds.
 *
 * **Example** (Decode a pending-on-client answer)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { AnswerRow } from "@beep/law-practice-domain"
 * import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"
 * import * as S from "effect/Schema"
 *
 * const row = Effect.runSync(
 *   S.decodeUnknownEffect(AnswerRow)({
 *     state: "pending-on-client",
 *     itemId: "question:1",
 *     revision: 1,
 *     recordedAt: 1_760_400_000_000,
 *     resurfaceOn: "2026-11-02",
 *     note: "Waiting on the client's instructions.",
 *   })
