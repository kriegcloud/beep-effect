/**
 * Closed reasons a claim cannot be decomposed into a claim-element tree.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * - `claim-not-in-claims`: the claim's number is not one of the claims it was
 *   given as context, so its dependency chain cannot be read;
 * - `unsupported-claim-text`: the claim text has no segmentable structure the
 *   decomposer can anchor elements to;
 * - `incoherent-tree`: the decomposed elements and edges fail the
 *   `ClaimElementTree` coherence check.
 *
 * Phrasing that no antecedent rule covers is not a decomposition failure; it
 * surfaces later as a `pattern-not-covered` finding.
 *
 * **Example** (Inspect decomposition reasons)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { ClaimDecompositionReason } from "@beep/law-practice-domain/values/ClaimElement"
 *
 * console.log(ClaimDecompositionReason.is["incoherent-tree"]("incoherent-tree")) // true
 * ```
