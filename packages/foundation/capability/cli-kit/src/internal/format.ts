/**
 * Core's structured formatter, with one phrasing override.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * Built once: it is a pure function of the issue tree and carries no state.
 *
 * Core renders an excess property as `"Expected no excess property"`, which
 * describes the **schema's rule** rather than the **user's mistake**. The path
 * already names the key, so `unknown key at groups.g.cleanup.rulesetz` says the
 * same thing in the words someone editing a config file would use. Every other
 * leaf keeps core's phrasing, which is why this goes through `defaultLeafHook`
 * rather than a table of our own.

/**
 * Flatten an issue tree to one line per rejected value.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * Shared by `SchemaIssueRenderer` and `ConfigIssueRenderer` and imported by
 * nothing else. It lives here rather than in either module so that
 * `ConfigIssueRenderer` — the only export that references the optional
 * `@effected/config-file` peer — can stay a module no other module imports.
 *
 * **No walker of our own.** `makeFormatterStandardSchemaV1` already flattens the
 * tree to `{ message, path }` entries, and `defaultLeafHook` covers every leaf
 * variant, so a wrong *type* renders as sensibly as an unknown key and a
 * variant added upstream is covered without a change here.
 *
 * Nodes are never stringified: each carries the entire AST inline, annotations
 * included, so `String(node)` would dump the schema rather than describe the
 * failure. Only `message` and `path` are read.
 *
 * **Example** (Ignore a value that is not a schema issue)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { formatIssue } from "@beep/cli-kit/internal/format"
 *
 * console.log(JSON.stringify(formatIssue("unstructured failure"))) // []
