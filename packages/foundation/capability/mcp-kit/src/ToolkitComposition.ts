/**
 * Credential-keyed toolkit composition.
 *
 * Build-time helper that folds a set of {@link SourceAuth.SourceAuthRegistration}-tagged
 * layers into a single layer, applying the hybrid gate policy from
 * `SourceAuth`: `hard`-gated layers vanish from the fold entirely when their
 * credential is absent; `none`/`soft`-gated layers always fold in (they
 * degrade at call time instead — see `ApiKeyRequired`).
 *
 * Mounted layers fold via `Layer.mergeAll`, mirroring the seam already used
 * at `packages/drivers/nlp-mcp/src/Server.ts:101-107` (an equivalent
 * `Array.reduce(Layer.merge, Layer.empty)` fold works identically — see
 * `SPEC.md`; `Layer.orElse` does not exist in `effect@4`). Credential-
 * conditional layer selection happens inside an `Effect.gen` that a
 * `Layer.unwrap` promotes back into a `Layer`.
