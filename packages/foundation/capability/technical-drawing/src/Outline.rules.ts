/**
 * Pure sheet-domain outline rules: find drawn lines that run side by side
 * closer than a legible centre spacing, and open them to it.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * A thin face seen nearly edge-on projects its two long edges as two
 * parallel lines a fraction of a millimetre apart. Closer than twice the line
 * weight (0.7 mm centre to centre for 0.35 mm lines, the least spacing of
 * parallel lines in ISO 128) the pair prints as one line of the double
 * weight an emphasis line has (review loop 4, O-01). A draftsperson opens
 * such a pair to the least spacing and keeps both lines, so the board edge
 * still reads as two lines and every break in them keeps its width;
 * {@link separateCloseOutlines} does the same on the sheet, and
 * {@link closeOutlineGaps} measures what is left.

/**
 * Opens drawn lines that run side by side closer than `minSpacing` (centre
 * to centre) to that spacing, keeping both lines.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * Strokes collinear within `coincidence` form one line when they overlap, when
 * a break no wider than five `minSpacing` parts them (a partial duplicate, a
 * narrow break), or when a line crossing at 10° or more runs through each end
 * facing a wider gap, clear of its own ends (a line passing behind a part in
 * front of it, so its pieces either side move together). Collinear edges that
 * otherwise end apart, such as two boxes' level tops meeting their own
 * corners, are separate lines and move on their own. Two lines conflict where
 * a stroke of each
 * runs within 3° of parallel beside the other over at least `minOverlap`,
 * their nearer spacing over that overlap lying above `coincidence` and under
 * `minSpacing`. One line moves straight away from the other by the largest
 * shortfall, so a converging pair ends at least `minSpacing` apart
 * everywhere. Of the two, the line that moves is the one whose move brings
 * no settled line beside it too close, then a line not yet placed, then the
 * line drawn shorter; a run of close lines thus opens outward from its
 * longest, and a stacked pair moves away from a neighbour it would crowd.
 * `emphasis` lines move with the outline they are drawn over, and a line
 * carrying one moves only when nothing else can. `broken` lines move like
 * `segments`.
 *
 * After the moves every end is solved again. A line drawn at least three
 * least spacings long keeps its direction: an end meets again the steepest
 * line through it that crosses at least 10° (an unmoved one first), so an
 * unmoved line's ends only slide along it, a vertex where unmoved lines meet
 * stays put, a moved line is re-ended on the lines it ran to, and a break
 * between two pieces of one line keeps its place on the lines crossing it. A
 * shorter line is a connector: its ends follow the lines it joins. An end
 * stands on a line within 2% of `coincidence`, and never closer than one and
 * a half `quantum` steps, so ends the kernel rounded off the lines they meet
 * are still found on a drawing enlarged far past its model units. The
 * result is measured again and opened again, at most four times, and the
 * drawing that falls least short of the spacing is returned. Lengths are in
 * the segments' units.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * Each returned array is the input array itself when no line moved, so a
 * caller can tell an untouched drawing by reference. Segments keep their
 * order and direction; only moved endpoints change. A spacing exactly at
 * `minSpacing` can print a hair under it once coordinates are rounded, so a
 * caller holding a printed spacing asks for a small margin more.
 *
 * **Example** (A board edge drawn 0.34 apart opens to 0.7)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { separateCloseOutlines } from "@beep/technical-drawing/Outline.rules"
 *
 * const result = separateCloseOutlines({
 *   segments: [[0, 0, 100, 0], [0, 0.34, 90, 0.34]],
 *   minSpacing: 0.7,
 *   minOverlap: 1,
 *   coincidence: 0.15
 * })
 * console.log(result.segments[1], result.moves) // [0, 0.7, 90, 0.7] [0.36]
 * ```
 *
 * @param input - The outline segments, the broken lines drawn with them, the emphasis lines drawn over them, the
 * spacing, overlap and coincidence thresholds, and the step the coordinates are rounded to (`quantum`, default 0),
 * all in the segments' units.
 * @returns The separated segments, broken lines and emphasis lines, and how far each moved line moved.
