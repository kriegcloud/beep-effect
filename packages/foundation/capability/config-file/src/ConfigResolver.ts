   *
   * **Details**
   *
   * `filenames` replaces `filename` with a per-directory candidate list: every
   * name is probed at one ancestor before the walk ascends, so a child's
   * second candidate still beats a parent's first. Registering one resolver
   * per filename cannot do this — the chain runs a resolver to the filesystem
   * root before starting the next.
   *
   * `name` overrides the reported `"walk"` so two walks in one chain are
   * distinguishable; `ConfigSource.match` identifies the matching candidate
   * more precisely still.
   *
   * **Example** (Probe multiple filenames at each ancestor)
   *
   * ```ts
   * import { ConfigResolver } from "@beep/config-file/ConfigResolver";
   * import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";
