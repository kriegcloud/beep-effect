/**
 * Pattern source to matching files in one call with one typed error: the compile-and-expand recipe.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * `Descend` answers "which files match this COMPILED pattern"; this module
 * answers "which files match this pattern SOURCE". The seam between them —
 * compile, fold the compile error, expand, fold the descend error — is small
 * enough that every consumer wrote it themselves, and differently each time.
 * This module is that seam once: one spelling, one error to catch. It is the
 * only walker module that takes a VALUE import from `@beep/glob`
 * (`compileResult`); every other reference is type-and-property only.

 * rather than flattening it into a string. Discriminate on `cause._tag`

 * original payload — a guard's `limit`/`actual`, a descent's `path` — is still
 * there. `cause` is also the native `Error` cause, so error chaining and
 * stack-printing work without extra wiring.

/**
 * Compile a glob pattern and expand it against the filesystem in one call:
 * matching FILE paths relative to `options.cwd`, POSIX separators, sorted.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * The recipe form of `descend`. Everything `descend` documents about
 * traversal holds unchanged — the literal fast-path, the negated-pattern walk
 * from `cwd`, files-only matching, symlink and prune handling, `maxDepth`,
 * `onUnreadable` — because this delegates to it. What this adds is the seam:
 * the pattern arrives as a string, and both failure modes arrive as one
 * {@link GlobExpansionError} with the underlying error preserved in `cause`.
 *
 * A missing base directory, a pattern that climbs above `cwd`, and a pattern
 * that simply matches nothing are all an EMPTY result, not a failure — zero
 * matches is a normal glob answer. Only a rejected pattern or a failed walk
 * produces an error.
 *
 * `FileSystem` and `Path` stay in the `R` channel and are **deliberately not
 * provided here**, even though hand-providing them is the friction this
 * recipe otherwise removes. `FileSystem` cannot be provided — a library that
 * picks its own filesystem cannot be tested against a fixture tree. Given
 * that, providing `Path` internally would not save the caller a layer (they
 * still supply `FileSystem`), and it would actively break win32: the walk
 * would join paths POSIX-style against a caller's win32 filesystem. The
 * consumer's platform layer stays the single place that choice is made.
 * Provide both once at the application boundary, not per call site.
 *
 * **Example** (Compile and expand a TypeScript glob)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { GlobPatternOptions } from "@beep/glob/GlobPattern";
 * import { compileAndExpand } from "@beep/walker/Expand";
 * import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";
 *
 * const program = compileAndExpand("src/*.ts", { cwd: "/repo", glob: GlobPatternOptions.make({ dot: true }) });
 * // Sorted, cwd-relative POSIX paths; fails with `GlobExpansionError`.
 * // Requires `FileSystem` and `Path` from the platform layer.
 * console.log(Effect.isEffect(program)) // true
 * ```
