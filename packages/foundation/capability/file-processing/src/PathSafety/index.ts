/**
 * Shared path-traversal safety guard for local file reads and writes.
 *
 * Given an allowed root directory and a candidate path, this module resolves
 * the real, canonical absolute path and fails closed (typed
 * {@link PathSafetyError}) when the resolved path escapes the root via an
 * absolute path outside the root, a `..` traversal, or a symlink that points
 * outside the root.
 *
 * The Effect-returning guard ({@link resolvePathWithinRoot}) uses the
 * runtime-neutral `FileSystem` and `Path` services from the main `effect`
 * package so callers supply the platform implementation (for example
 * `@effect/platform-node`) through a layer. A pure validation
 * ({@link validateResolvedPath} / {@link isPathWithinRoot}) is provided for
 * already-resolved absolute strings where the filesystem is not consulted.
 *
 * Rejecting non-regular or device files is intentionally out of scope for this
 * helper; callers stat and reject those after the path is proven in-root.
