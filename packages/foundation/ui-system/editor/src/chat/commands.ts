/**
 * Lexical commands the {@link ChatComposer} dispatches so consumers can wire
 * send/stop without the foundation knowing about turns, drafts, or transport.
 *
 * The send button click and the Enter-to-send key handler both dispatch
 * {@link SEND_MESSAGE_COMMAND}. A consumer handles it either by passing an
 * `onSend` prop (the composer registers a low-priority handler) or by
 * registering its own higher-priority handler from a child plugin (e.g. an
 * Effect-Atom binding that reads the editor state directly). An unhandled
 * command is a no-op, so the composer is safe to use without a handler.
