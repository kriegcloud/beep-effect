 * Enter-to-send key handling and the live character count.
 *
 * Per the deep-research a11y contract, Enter-to-send is suppressed while an IME
 * composition session is active (`KeyboardEvent.isComposing`), so committing a
 * CJK/diacritic candidate never sends. The send keystroke itself is configurable
 * via `sendOn`; both the key handler and the send button dispatch the same
 * {@link SEND_MESSAGE_COMMAND}. Per the repo atom-first law the key registration
 * and the character count are per-editor `@effect/atom` bindings (no `useEffect`,
 * no `useState`); see {@link sendKeyBindingAtom} and {@link characterCountAtom}.

 * sends, and Enter while a typeahead menu is open selects the option instead.
