/**
 * The package manager a `pnpm-lock.yaml` pins, with the integrity pnpm
 * recorded for it — read from the lockfile's env preamble by
 * `PnpmEnvLockfile.packageManager`.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * pnpm records the package manager a workspace declares in
 * `devEngines.packageManager` as the root importer's
 * `packageManagerDependencies` in the env preamble document, and resolves it
 * like any other dependency: the preamble's `packages:` section carries its
 * integrity, and pnpm refuses to run a manager whose identity does not match.
 * That makes the lockfile, not the `+sha512.<hex>` suffix on the declared
 * version, the checksum store for the manager itself.
 *
 * - `name` — the package-manager package, always `"pnpm"`.
 * - `specifier` — the declared specifier, verbatim. It may still carry the
 *   corepack-style `+sha512.<hex>` suffix the manifest declared it with.
 * - `version` — the exact version pnpm resolved the specifier to.
 * - `integrity` — the SRI integrity (`sha512-<base64>`) of the
 *   `pnpm@<version>` package.
 * - `nativeIntegrity` — SRI integrity per native package, keyed by package
 *   name with no version (`"@pnpm/exe.linux-x64"`): every package the lockfile
 *   records as an optional dependency of `pnpm@<version>`. pnpm 12 records one
 *   `@pnpm/exe.<target>` entry per platform there; pnpm 11 records none, so
 *   the record is empty — pnpm 11 hangs its platform binaries off a separate
 *   `@pnpm/exe` wrapper entry instead, which this model does not carry.
 *
 * **Example** (Inspect the pinned manager version)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { PackageManagerLock } from "@beep/lockfiles/PackageManagerLock";
 *
 * const manager = PackageManagerLock.make({ name: "pnpm", specifier: "12.7.0", version: "12.7.0", integrity: "sha512-YWJj", nativeIntegrity: {} });
 * console.log(manager.version); // 12.7.0
 * ```
