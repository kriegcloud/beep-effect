/**
 * A directed dependency edge between two workspace packages as recorded in
 * the lockfile.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * - `from` — the workspace package declaring the dependency. For pnpm this
 *   is the importer path until `Lockfile#withImporterNames` rewrites it.
 * - `to` — the workspace package depended upon.
 * - `depType` — which dependency map holds the edge, spelled with
 *   `@effected/npm`'s kit-wide `DependencyField` vocabulary.
 * - `constraint` — the declared specifier (e.g. `"workspace:*"`, `"^1.0.0"`).
 *
 * **Example** (Construct a workspace dependency edge)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { WorkspaceDependency } from "@beep/lockfiles/WorkspaceDependency";
 *
 * const edge = WorkspaceDependency.make({ from: "@acme/app", to: "@acme/lib", depType: "dependencies", constraint: "workspace:*" });
 * console.log(edge.constraint); // workspace:*
 * ```
