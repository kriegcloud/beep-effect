// The one door an `SbomDocument` goes through on its way out of `Sbom.generate`.
//
// `SbomDocument.make` validates and copies the whole document graph, so the
// emitter's admission work is the size of what it hands that one `make` (W4-b).
// `test/Sbom.admission.test.ts` pins that work, and it can only see it here: a
// schema's `make` memoizes itself as a non-configurable own property on first
// read, so it cannot be wrapped once any test in a shared worker has built a
// document. `admission` is a plain object, so a test can swap `admit` and
// restore it.
