 * so the context is eager by nature; the streaming token form exists for

 *
 * `text`, `lines` and `tokens` cover the FULL source; `document` is the
 * FIRST document of the stream (matching `Yaml.parse` — split the stream
 * `Yaml.parseAll`-style to lint every document). It is always present,
 * including for input that does not parse: it is built from the engine's
 * recovered compose, and its `errors`/`warnings` carry what went wrong (the
 * `parse-validity` rule reports them).

/**
 * One categorical style observation: a single occurrence of a style
 * choice in the source, voting a `value` for an inference `dimension`.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * The `dimension` IS the rule's option key and the `value` IS that option's
 * value (`"double"` for `quoteType`, `2` for `spaces`, `false` for
 * `present`), so the inference resolvers can turn unanimous or dominant
 * votes into a config entry with no per-rule knowledge — which is what lets
 * custom rules participate in inference for free. The position points at the
 * occurrence that voted, so a strict-resolution conflict can name where each
 * spelling was seen.
 *
 * The `_tag` literal is the RUNTIME discriminator between the two
 * observation kinds: class instances are structurally assignable, so a
 * custom rule may yield a plain object shaped like a vote, and the evidence
 * builder must still sort it into the right tally without `instanceof`.
 * `.make` defaults it — construction sites never pass `_tag`.
 *
 * **Example** (Record an indentation style vote)

 * import { StyleVote } from "@beep/yaml/YamlLintRule"
