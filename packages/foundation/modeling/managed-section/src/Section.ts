/**
 * The name identifying a managed section, as it literally appears in the
 * file's markers.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * Keys are **case-sensitive** and rendered verbatim: the key a consumer
 * declares is the key the marker carries. A file already containing
 * `SAVVY-LINT` markers is managed by declaring the key `"SAVVY-LINT"`.
 *
 * The character set is bounded so a key can always be read back out of a
 * marker unambiguously — whitespace in particular would make the scanner's
 * key capture ambiguous against the marker phrase that follows it.
 *
 * This is a checked string rather than a branded one **deliberately**: a
 * brand would force every call site through a decode step to spell
 * `SectionId.make({ key: "example-tool", … })`, and the validation a brand
 * would carry is already enforced by the check at construction.
 *
 * **Example** (Validate a case-sensitive marker key)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { SectionKey } from "@beep/managed-section/Section";
 * import * as S from "effect/Schema";
 *
 * console.log(S.is(SectionKey)("SAVVY-LINT")) // true
 * console.log(S.is(SectionKey)("two words")) // false
 * ```

/**
 * A managed section: an identity plus the content its owner wants between the
 * markers.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * Equality is **structural and whitespace-significant**: a template change that
 * alters only indentation is a real change and reaches the file. The one
 * normalization this package applies is to line endings, and it happens at
 * parse time rather than inside equality, so `Equal.equals` stays honest for
 * a consumer comparing two sections directly.
 *
 * `attributes` are `name="value"` pairs carried on the BEGIN marker — metadata
 * a tool wants readable from the marker line itself, without opening the
 * content. They **participate in equality** (an attribute change is real
 * drift) but **never in identity**: the section a marker names is decided by
 * key and comment style alone, so changing an attribute updates a block in
 * place rather than orphaning it. Equality over attributes is record equality
 * — order-insensitive, so two sections carrying the same pairs in different
 * insertion orders compare equal — while an actual rewrite renders the pairs
 * in the record's insertion order. Omitting the field and passing `{}` are
 * the same section: the constructor defaults to an empty record.
 *
 * Attribute names must match `[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_-]*` and values may not
 * contain `"` or a line break; violations fail typed at render, not here, so
 * runtime data can never turn construction into a defect.
 *
 * **Example** (Construct a section with empty metadata)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Section } from "@beep/managed-section/Section";
 * import { CommentStyle } from "@beep/managed-section/CommentStyle";
 * import * as R from "effect/Record";
 *
 * const section = Section.make({ key: "tool", commentStyle: CommentStyle.hash, content: "echo hello" });
 * console.log(R.isEmptyRecord(section.attributes)) // true
