 * HTTP basic auth — npm's `_auth`, carried as the **already-encoded** blob.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * The credential is base64 of `user:password`, and this type deliberately holds
 * it **encoded rather than as a pair**, because that is what npm itself stores
 * and what registry configuration in the wild already contains. npm assigns the
 * `_auth` value straight to the `Authorization: Basic …` header with no decode
 * step; splitting it back into a pair in order to re-encode it would mean
 * decoding a secret for no purpose, and is lossy in principle for a password
 * containing `:`.
 *
 * {@link basicCredentialFromPair} exists for the caller who genuinely holds a
 * pair — but this shape is the primitive, not that one.
 *
 *
 * **Example** (Carry an already encoded basic credential)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { BasicCredential } from "@beep/npm-spec/RegistryCredential";
 * import * as Redacted from "effect/Redacted";

 * configuration already has one.
 *
 * The password stays `Redacted` on the way in and the result stays `Redacted`
 * on the way out, so the pair is never materialized in a loggable value.

 * import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";
 * import * as Redacted from "effect/Redacted";

 *   auth and is refused rather than silently corrupting the credential.
