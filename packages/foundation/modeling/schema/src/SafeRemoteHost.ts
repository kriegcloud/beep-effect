/**
 * Shared SSRF guard for outbound HTTP(S) requests.
 *
 * Classifies the *literal* hostname or IP of a target URL before any
 * `HttpClient` request is issued and rejects loopback, link-local, RFC1918/ULA
 * private, and cloud-metadata (`169.254.169.254`) targets. This bounds the SSRF
 * surface of drivers that accept attacker-influenced URLs (USPTO, Box, the NLP
 * MCP dataset loaders, and friends): a prompt-injected or malicious caller must
 * not be able to reach those ranges via a literal address.
 *
 * The module exposes a pure boolean predicate ({@link isBlockedRemoteHost}) and
 * two fail-closed Effect assertions ({@link assertAllowedRemoteHost} and
 * {@link assertAllowedRemoteUrl}) that reject with a typed
 * {@link BlockedHostError}. An optional allowlist permits explicitly trusted
 * hosts (matched case-insensitively against the normalized hostname).
 *
 * @remarks
 * By default the guard only inspects the literal hostname/IP and does **not**
 * perform DNS resolution: a public DNS name that resolves to `127.0.0.1` or
 * `169.254.169.254` is not caught unless a resolver is supplied. To close that
 * gap, callers may pass `options.resolve` to {@link assertAllowedRemoteHost} /
 * {@link assertAllowedRemoteUrl}; every resolved A/AAAA address is then run
 * through the same internal-range classifier and the request is rejected if any
 * resolved address is internal.
 *
 * Resolution is opt-in by injection so this foundation schema package stays free
 * of direct `node:dns` I/O (driver packages provide the resolver). Even with a
 * resolver, a DNS-rebinding attacker can return a public address to this guard
 * and an internal address to the subsequent connection (a TOCTOU window):
 * eliminating that residual risk requires pinning the resolved IP at the HTTP
 * client connection layer, which is out of scope for this schema-level guard.
