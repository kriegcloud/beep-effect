# @beep/schema

Reusable Effect Schema substrate for the repo.

`@beep/schema` is a `foundation/modeling` package. It owns domain-agnostic
schemas, codecs, schema combinators, typed schema errors, and schema-adjacent
modeling helpers that slices, shared-kernel packages, drivers, and tooling may
reuse without taking product-domain dependencies.

## Topology

Canonical schema concept imports are namespace-first:

```ts
import * as Duration from "@beep/schema/Duration"
import * as Glob from "@beep/schema/Glob"

Duration.Input
Duration.FromInput
Glob.Schema
```

The package root remains a curated flat facade:

```ts
import { DurationInput, Glob, TaggedErrorClass } from "@beep/schema"
```

Root flat exports are convenience and compatibility, not the canonical home for
full concept namespaces.

Leaf concept modules use small role files:

```txt
src/Duration/
  Duration.schema.ts
  Duration.input.ts
  Duration.transforms.ts
  index.ts
```

Only `@beep/schema/<Concept>` is public for concept modules. Role files are
source topology. Utility namespaces such as `SchemaUtils` may expose helper
leaves when direct helper imports are the intended API.

Public package subpaths are explicit. `SchemaUtils` helper leaves such as
`@beep/schema/SchemaUtils/pluck` remain intentional public imports, but concept
role files such as `@beep/schema/Duration/Duration.schema` are private source
topology.

Former topical families are represented by PascalCase leaf concept modules and
canonical public subpaths:

```ts
import * as Color from "@beep/schema/Color"
import * as Csv from "@beep/schema/Csv"
import * as HttpStatus from "@beep/schema/HttpStatus"
```

Do not create broad suite aggregators such as `@beep/schema/Blockchain`,
`@beep/schema/Dom`, `@beep/schema/Http`, `@beep/schema/Location`, or
`@beep/schema/Person`. Lowercase topical source and public paths such as
`src/color/`, `src/http/`, `@beep/schema/color`, and
`@beep/schema/http/headers` are retired.

`Csv` is a same-concept schema module; parser, formatter, option, and error
helpers live in their own leaf modules such as `@beep/schema/CsvParser` and are
not re-exported from `@beep/schema/Csv`.

Package-local tests may use source-only test seams such as
`@beep/schema/test/Markdown` and `@beep/schema/test/Yaml`. Parser internals
under `src/internal/` are not public package subpaths, and the test seam
implementations live under `src/internal/test`.

Topology is enforced by:

```bash
bun run beep lint schema-topology
```

See `goals/beep-schema-topology` and `standards/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the
canonical migration plan and doctrine.

## Installation

```bash
bun add @beep/schema
```

## Usage

```ts
import * as Duration from "@beep/schema/Duration"
import * as S from "effect/Schema"

const decodeDuration = S.decodeUnknownEffect(Duration.FromInput)
console.log(decodeDuration)
```
