/**
 * Core type representing an event definition in LiveStore.
 *
 * An EventDef defines the structure and behavior of an event type, including:
 * - A unique name identifying the event type (conventionally versioned, e.g., `v1.TodoCreated`)
 * - A schema for validating and encoding/decoding event arguments
 * - Options controlling sync behavior and constraints
 *
 * EventDefs are callable - invoking them creates a partial event object suitable for `store.commit()`.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Events } from '@beep/livestore'
 * import { Schema } from 'effect'
 *
 * const todoCreated = Events.synced({
 *   name: 'v1.TodoCreated',
 *   schema: Schema.Struct({
 *     id: Schema.String,
 *     text: Schema.String,
 *   }),
 * })
 *
 * // Use the EventDef as a constructor
 * store.commit(todoCreated({ id: 'abc', text: 'Buy milk' }))
 * ```
