# Effect Office Hours

Hey friends! Super pumped to crash office hours and soak up some wisdom. I brought a handful of topics that have me pacing around the repo‚Äîhappy to dive into whichever feel the most fun or valuable for you all.

- **Managed runtime √ó better-auth (Next.js entrypoint adventures)**
  - `packages/iam/infra/src/adapters/better-auth/Auth.service.ts` assembles the Better Auth options inside an `Effect` service: I grab `IamDb.IamDb`, the drizzle adapter, email hooks, etc., and return `{ auth: betterAuth(opts) }`. Downstream, the Next.js route in `apps/web/src/app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts` just runs `runServerPromise(AuthService, "auth.route")` and hands back `auth.handler`.
  - My server runtime server-runtime.ts comes from `ManagedRuntime.make(AppLive)`, merging telemetry (`NodeSdk`, OTLP exporters), logging, database layers, and the auth services. Inside the Better Auth config I still call `Effect.runPromise` directly for hooks like `sendResetPassword` and the database triggers, which means all that juicy instrumentation and FiberRef context from the managed runtime never sees those calls.
  - I‚Äôd love a sanity check on approaches here: should the Next.js route hold onto the `serverRuntime` and thread `runServerPromise` (or the raw runtime) into the Better Auth config so hooks run inside the same managed environment? Or is it cleaner to spin up a sibling `ManagedRuntime` just for the adapter? Totally possible I‚Äôm thinking about this backwards, so any patterns y‚Äôall lean on for wiring Effect runtimes into third-party handlers would be üî•.

- **Scoped drizzle clients, transactions, and `Context.GenericTag` lore**
  - I'm leaning on the factory in db.factory.ts: it builds a scoped drizzle client, exposes `transaction`, and creates a `Context.GenericTag` (`TransactionContext`) so queries can detect if they‚Äôre inside an open tx and reuse the provided `TransactionClient`. That tag gets re-exposed by each slice iam//Db.ts, files/Db.ts, db-admin/Db.ts with their own schema-bound layers.
  - For runtime ergonomics I‚Äôve started splitting ‚Äúgod clients‚Äù into scoped ones (`IamDb`, `FilesDb`, etc.) plus matching repos so I can keep TS inference tolerable on large code paths. My current thinking is that `makeQuery` + the transaction context lets each slice expose a narrow API without leaking the full schema.
  - I‚Äôd love a quick review: does the `TransactionContext` trick look idiomatic to you? Are there sharper ways to thread typed drizzle clients + transactions through services without blowing up compile times? Open to being roasted if I‚Äôve reinvented something goofy.

- **Better Auth client adapter (handler factory, instrumentation, fiber refs)**
  - Client-side I wrap Better Auth in handler-factory.ts + pals. `AuthHandler.make` wires together schema encoding, retries, timeouts, metrics instrumentation/metrics.ts, tracing instrumentation/tracing.ts, and that keyed semaphore guard concurrency/semaphore-registry.ts. Everything funnels through `callAuth`, which normalizes the `{ data, error }` responses into the `IamError` type I expose.
  - In my UI flows (e.g. sign-in.view.tsx) I grab a managed client runtime via `useRuntime()` and execute handlers with `makeRunClientPromise(runtime, "iam.signIn.email")`. Everything *works*, but the whole mapper/factory stack still feels like I might be over-engineering or missing some obvious escape hatches, especially around FiberRef propagation and the `AuthHandler.map` bridge that unwraps Better Auth client promises.
  - Would appreciate a code review mindset here: anything obviously risky, or patterns you‚Äôve used to keep these adapters lean while still getting observability + UX niceties? Happy to zoom in on any part of the stack.

- **Effect monorepo tooling curiosities**
  - Build scripts: I shamelessly cargo-culted the Effect repo‚Äôs triple threat (`build`, `build-esm`, `build-annotate`) instead of bundlers like tsup/vite. Folks have side-eyed me for it‚Äîcurious if there‚Äôs a philosophy behind sticking with direct TypeScript + Babel/CLI outputs for internal packages.
  - Type inference ergonomics: any tips you use to keep TS snappy on large layer graphs? I‚Äôve been sprinkling explicit signatures (e.g. `const myLayer: Layer.Layer<...>`) and leaning on `peerDependencies`/`devDependencies` the way `@effect/sql` does, but I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm using the sharpest tools.
  - Monorepo orchestration: do you foresee Effect adopting Turborepo/Nx or similar? Wondering if there are strategies you already like for pipeline orchestration without them.

No pressure to hit every bullet‚Äîwhatever sparks the best conversation works for me. If it helps, I can hop on the call with code pulled up and we can poke at anything live. Everything‚Äôs OSS and ripe for critique. Appreciate you all! ‚úåÔ∏è
