# Effect Office Hours

Hey friends! Super pumped to crash office hours and soak up some wisdom. I brought a handful of topics that have me pacing around the repo—happy to dive into whichever feel the most fun or valuable for you all.

- **Better Auth client adapter (handler factory, instrumentation, fiber refs)**
  - Client-side I wrap Better Auth in handler-factory.ts + pals. `AuthHandler.make` wires together schema encoding, retries, timeouts, metrics instrumentation/metrics.ts, tracing instrumentation/tracing.ts, and that keyed semaphore guard concurrency/semaphore-registry.ts. Everything funnels through `callAuth`, which normalizes the `{ data, error }` responses into the `IamError` type I expose.
  - In my UI flows (e.g. sign-in.view.tsx) I grab a managed client runtime via `useRuntime()` and execute handlers with `makeRunClientPromise(runtime, "iam.signIn.email")`. Everything *works*, but the whole mapper/factory stack still feels like I might be over-engineering or missing some obvious escape hatches, especially around FiberRef propagation and the `AuthHandler.map` bridge that unwraps Better Auth client promises.
  - Would appreciate a code review mindset here: anything obviously risky, or patterns you’ve used to keep these adapters lean while still getting observability + UX niceties? Happy to zoom in on any part of the stack.

- **Effect monorepo tooling curiosities**
  - Build scripts: I shamelessly cargo-culted the Effect repo’s triple threat (`build`, `build-esm`, `build-annotate`) instead of bundlers like tsup/vite. Folks have side-eyed me for it—curious if there’s a philosophy behind sticking with direct TypeScript + Babel/CLI outputs for internal packages.
  - Type inference ergonomics: any tips you use to keep TS snappy on large layer graphs? I’ve been sprinkling explicit signatures (e.g. `const myLayer: Layer.Layer<...>`) and leaning on `peerDependencies`/`devDependencies` the way `@effect/sql` does, but I’m not sure I’m using the sharpest tools.
  - Monorepo orchestration: do you foresee Effect adopting Turborepo/Nx or similar? Wondering if there are strategies you already like for pipeline orchestration without them.

No pressure to hit every bullet—whatever sparks the best conversation works for me. If it helps, I can hop on the call with code pulled up and we can poke at anything live. Everything’s OSS and ripe for critique. Appreciate you all! ✌️
