## Problem

beep's agents (librarian, researchers, patent drafters) need to reach the
practice's real documents and correspondence — which, for Tom's OIP practice as
for most lawyers, live in Microsoft 365 (OneDrive/SharePoint, Outlook,
Word/Excel). Today there is no connector: the runtime data loop ingests local
fixtures only, and the product authority's standing open question is *"which
existing tools will the practice use for document storage?"* The answer is M365 —
and a privileged-data practice cannot route that content through an opaque
third-party process. We need an owned, observable, least-privilege way in.

## Appetite

A thin, owned slice: a native `@beep/m365` Graph driver plus an MCP exposure —
**read-only first, write-ready by design**. Explicitly NOT a full Graph SDK, NOT
the document-portal MVP, and NOT a write/automation surface. Budget is two small
driver packages that mirror existing precedents (`@beep/hubspot`, `@beep/box`,
`@beep/nlp-mcp`); anything larger graduates as a separate follow-on.

## Solution Sketch

```
Entra app (delegated, auth-code + PKCE)
      │  @azure/msal-node  (token provider, encrypted cache)
      ▼
@beep/m365  ──  FetchHttpClient + effect/Schema  ──►  Microsoft Graph v1.0
   read verbs:
     Files/Sites : list drives/sites · delta · download content ·
                   listItem.fields + /versions
     Mail/Cal    : list/get messages · list/get events
      │  Context.Service + Layer · M365Error typed errors · S.Redacted secrets ·
      │  OTel spans (counts/sizes, never raw content)
      ▼
@beep/m365-mcp  ──  effect/unstable/ai (Tool.make · McpServer.layerStdio)  ──►
      agents in apps/professional-desktop

(future) m365-document-ingest:  content → @beep/tika / @beep/langextract →
      @beep/epistemic-domain candidate claims, matter-walled.
```

The driver's service shape, auth, error, and scope model are write-ready, so the
later "true assistant" phase adds write verbs/scopes (or delegates write-back to
Microsoft's Work IQ MCP servers, now an option since Copilot is present) without a
rewrite.

## Rabbit Holes

- Layered, per-service throttling — honor `Retry-After`; budget SharePoint
  resource units (a solo tenant sits in the lowest tier).
- Encrypted / sensitivity-labeled files — detect + flag + skip in v1; never
  `Content.SuperUser`.
- Desktop token-cache encryption (`@azure/msal-node-extensions`); keep secrets in
  the sidecar, never the renderer.
- No structured Word API — `.docx` text comes from `@beep/tika` after byte
  download (an ingest concern, but it shapes the driver's content verb).
- Delta-token lifecycle and `410 Gone` resync.
- Graph surface drift — pin `v1.0`; track the changelog (24-month deprecation).

## No-Gos

- No write scopes or write verbs in v1 (read-only; write-ready shape only).
- No off-the-shelf MCP sidecar as the durable core (owned driver instead).
- No Work IQ / Copilot dependency for ingest (local-first).
- No document-portal ingest wiring in these two goals (that is the follow-on).
- No Teams or Excel-workbook-content verbs in v1.
- No Microsoft Search API in v1.
