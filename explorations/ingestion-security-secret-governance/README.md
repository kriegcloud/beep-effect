# Ingestion Security + Secret/PII Governance

## Status

Stage: `research`
Status: `active`

Source: [`ops/manifest.json`](./ops/manifest.json)

## Spark

Every counterparty document, scraped opinion, and user-supplied URL crossing
into beep is adversarial input, and every provider key plus privileged span is
a leak waiting to happen — this wedge gathers the defensive ingestion gate
(prompt-injection detection, SSRF hardening, secret/PII scrub-before-LLM,
failed-redaction x-ray) and the secret-governance spine (ordered resolution
chain + per-user vault) that today have no home.

## Next Open Question

**Q1: Scope boundary — one ingestion-security wedge vs split content-security
gate + shared secret-governance spine.** Highest-leverage open fork: it decides
whether the secret-governance spine (resolver + vault) graduates with this
packet at all or rides `multi-provider-llm-dispatch-fallback`, and it frames
every package-placement and first-slice decision below it. Eight branch-closing
decisions are pre-drafted with recommendations in [`DECISIONS.md`](./DECISIONS.md)
— resolve them via `/grill-with-docs ingestion-security-secret-governance`.
