# Effect Orchestration Patterns — Sources & Provenance

Provenance ledger for this packet: it joins the 8 gold nuggets of the
gold-intake cluster **"Effect orchestration patterns (Schedule, Layer provider,
bounded fan-out)"** to their upstream repos + licenses, the external research
citations already on disk in this packet, and the in-repo `@beep/*` bricks the
work composes. An implementing agent should be able to trace any decision in
DECISIONS.md back through this file to (a) a mined nugget with its upstream
`file:line`, (b) the upstream repo + LICENSE, (c) an external citation, or (d) an
in-repo capability.

### How these inform this packet

**Retry-policy module (research-squad#3) — the primary net-new #1.**
Take the *shape*: a single module of named, rationale-documented schedules
(`llmRetry` 2 retries / `networkRetry` 5 retries / `databaseRetry`). Leave the
literal code: the seed's `Schedule.exponential(...).pipe(Schedule.compose(Schedule.recurs(2)))`
**will not compile** on the repo's `effect@4.0.0-beta.91` pin (`Schedule.compose`
is absent — bound a count with `Schedule.both(Schedule.recurs(n))`). The repo
already has a v4-idiomatic policy to generalize (`SqlTest.ts:616`
`PgConnectRetryPolicy = Schedule.both(Schedule.spaced(...), Schedule.recurs(20))`).
Implementing agent: DRY-extract anthropic's working `ExecutionPlan` retry into
this module; do not invent backoff math from scratch.

**Provider selection (research-squad#5) — primary net-new #2.**
Take the *adapter pattern*: read config at layer-build time and construct only
the chosen provider's Layer behind one provider-agnostic tag, so unused
providers' `Config.redacted` keys are never read. Leave the seed's API names:
`Layer.unwrapEffect` / `Layer.die` **do not exist in v4** — they merged into
`Layer.unwrap` and were removed respectively. Battle-tested in-repo precedents
exist (`M365.service.ts:1176`, `SqlTest.ts:1340`). Keep this build-time selector
distinct from runtime fallback/dispatch (separate proposed packet
`multi-provider-llm-dispatch-fallback`).

**Bounded fan-out + graceful degradation (research-squad#11).**
Take the structured-concurrency + per-item-recovery contract:
`Effect.forEach(tasks, withRecovery, { concurrency })` where a failure becomes a
`status:'failed'` item rather than aborting the batch. The `{ concurrency }`
options shape **still matches v4** (this is the one seed snippet that is not
broken). The repo already has production degraded fan-out to reuse
(`nlp/.../GraphOperations/Executor.ts` wraps each leaf in `Effect.result` and
folds failures into an `errors` array); net-new is only extracting that proven
shape into a generic tagged-status combinator.

**Failure-vs-defect + error taxonomy (research-squad#2, research-squad#7).**
Take the deliberate channel split (recoverable typed failures via `Effect.fail`
+ retry vs contract-violation defects via `Effect.die`) and the
`isRetryable`/`isDefect` predicate structure. **Load-bearing caution:** the
seed's "schema-validation of LLM output ⇒ defect" rule is **explicitly rejected**
for this repo — the real streamed-LLM path
(`AnthropicTurnKernel.ts:75-111`) treats a per-block decode failure as
*recoverable* (held for repair, dropped+logged, never died), and effect itself
marks `InvalidOutputError` as `isRetryable: true`. v4 GOTCHA: defect detection
moved from `Cause`-level (`Cause.isDie`) to `Reason<E>`-level
(`Cause.isDieReason`) — write `isDefect` against beta.91. Host the AI-free
helpers in `@beep/schema`; keep the `AiError.isRetryable` predicate LLM-scoped.

**Quota limiter (Juris.AI#5) — P2, governance-ops.**
The hand-rolled keyed sliding-window quota tracker is **structurally identical**
to v4's shipped `effect/unstable/persistence/RateLimiter`
(`consume({ key, limit, window, algorithm })` + `RateLimitExceeded.retryAfter`)
— **reuse the built-in, do not port** the JS. Net-new is only the
store-selection (`layerStoreMemory` vs `layerStoreRedis`) + per-provider
tier-config schema. Belongs to the deferred stateful-resilience scope.

**Resilience stack (uspto_pfw_mcp#5) — P2, deferred.**
The Python circuit-breaker (CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN) + served-while-open cache +
retry budget + bulkhead pools is the blueprint for the *heavier stateful* layer.
Effect core has **no** circuit breaker at any version
([effect#2843](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/issues/2843), open since
2024-05-24) → **clean-room a ~80–150-line `Ref`-held state machine from the
documented behavioral spec**, not from any source. v4 already ships the
bulkhead primitives (`Semaphore`, `PartitionedSemaphore`). This whole stack is
DECISIONS Q1's *deferred* fork (provisional sibling
`resilience-stack-circuit-breaker-budget`).

**Lazy reference-data load (courts-db#9) — P3, reference only.**
Python `__getattr__` lazy module-attribute load is a conceptual analogue for
deferring heavy reference-data builds; the Effect-native equivalent is
`Layer.unwrap`/`Layer.suspend` (build-time, memoized) or
`Effect.cached`/`cachedWithTTL` (first-access). Pattern only — vendoring
courts-db's *data tables* would require BSD attribution.

## 2. Upstream repositories & licenses

| Repo | Tier | License | Port discipline | What we take |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| research-squad | T1 | MIT | port-with-attribution (permissive) | Schedule retry policies (#3), `Layer.unwrap`-style provider selection (#5), bounded fan-out + recovery (#11), failure-vs-defect split (#2), error-taxonomy predicates (#7) |
| Juris.AI | T2 | MIT | port-with-attribution (permissive) — but superseded by v4 built-in | keyed sliding-window quota concept (#5); reuse `effect/unstable/.../RateLimiter` instead of porting |
| uspto_pfw_mcp | T1 | MIT | port-with-attribution (permissive) for behavior; CB itself clean-roomed | resilience blueprint (#5): circuit breaker, retry budget, served-while-open cache, bulkhead |
| courts-db | T1 | BSD-2-Clause | reference-only (concept); data-table vendoring needs BSD attribution | lazy reference-data load concept (#9) |

> **Caution (echoed from bundle).** This is **largely a library-extraction /
> consolidation task, not greenfield** — the laws (EF-25/26/27/31) and the
> per-driver retry+error code already exist in-repo. Scope must avoid rebuilding
> documented standards or working anthropic/openai-compat retry+error code:
> reuse and DRY-extract them. **No licensing concerns on the net-new core** —
> all of it is first-party Effect code (MIT) and the four upstream repos are
> permissive (MIT / BSD-2). **`Layer.unwrapEffect` must be validated against the
> vendored effect-v4 API before adopting** — done: it does not exist in v4; the
> v4 name is `Layer.unwrap` (6+ in-repo precedents).

> **License guard for the deferred CB (RESEARCH §Resilience).** The external
> circuit-breaker references **Cockatiel (MIT)** and **opossum (Apache-2.0)** are
> zero-dep but reference-only: a *close line-translation* of their source stays a
> derivative work and would still obligate carrying the upstream notice even with
> no dependency adopted. Implement the breaker from behavioral specs/tests, or
> preserve notices if any source is copied. AWS blogs, RFC 9110/6585, Google SRE,
> gRPC docs, and the IETF Idempotency-Key draft are **standards/concepts only —
> no code adopted, no license attaches.**
