# opaque-ttl-link-token-cryptography

Scope: external landscape for minting opaque, non-business-revealing, TTL-expiring download links with server-side key custody — encrypted vs signed token formats (Fernet/Branca/PASETO/iron/JWE/HMAC-URL), UUIDv4-opaque-id vs signed-token tradeoffs, the backing link store (SQLite/PGlite), and where the key lives so it never reaches the desktop/LLM. Porting targets: `uspto_pfw_mcp` `SecureLinkCache` (Python `cryptography` Fernet/DPAPI) + `patents-mcp-server` strict-UUID edge route.

## Findings

### The porting source: what we are replacing
- The original `SecureLinkCache` (Python) "stores app/document IDs encrypted in SQLite (Fernet), issues opaque non-business-revealing URLs, auto-expires (default 7 days), optional Windows DPAPI key protection, keeps the API key server-side." Constructor `__init__(self, cache_duration_days: int = 7, db_path=None)`. Source captured at `explorations/_gold-intake/research/per-repo/uspto_pfw_mcp.md:215-231` (origin `src/patent_filewrapper_mcp/proxy/secure_link_cache.py:24-55`).
- The companion edge route (`patents-mcp-server`) is a defense-in-depth guard, not the token system: `GET /resources/:file` validates the `.pdf` suffix + a strict v4-UUID regex (`UUID_V4.test(id)`) **before any fs access**, streams with `content-type: application/pdf` + `cache-control: private, no-store`, and 404s on expired/missing. Stated model: "access control at the edge; UUID+TTL is in-app defense-in-depth." Captured at `explorations/_gold-intake/research/per-repo/patents-mcp-server.md:255-274` (origin `src/resources/routes.ts:17-36`). Takeaway: the *link id* in the URL is opaque (a UUID), and the *encryption* protects the mapping (UUID → real app/document id) at rest — these are two separate mechanisms, not one token.

### Fernet (the thing being ported) — signed+encrypted symmetric token
- Fernet token wire format (concatenated, then base64url per RFC 4648): `Version (0x80, 8 bits) ‖ Timestamp (64-bit unsigned big-endian, seconds since epoch) ‖ IV (128 bits) ‖ Ciphertext (multiple of 128 bits) ‖ HMAC (256 bits)` — https://github.com/fernet/spec/blob/master/Spec.md
- Primitives: AES-128 in CBC mode with PKCS7 padding (RFC 5652 §6.3) for confidentiality; HMAC-SHA256 over `Version ‖ Timestamp ‖ IV ‖ Ciphertext` for integrity. The 256-bit key is base64url-encoded and split into a 128-bit signing-key (HMAC) + 128-bit encryption-key (AES) — https://github.com/fernet/spec/blob/master/Spec.md
- TTL is **not enforced inside the token** — at decrypt the caller passes a max-age/`ttl`; the recorded timestamp is checked "not too far in the past." Validation is application-defined. Limits: 64-bit timestamp (year 2286), single version `0x80`, **no key-rotation mechanism in spec** — https://github.com/fernet/spec/blob/master/Spec.md and https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/
- Relevance: Fernet = "encrypt-then-MAC, encode, TTL-at-decode." There is no first-class, actively-maintained Effect/TS Fernet, so a port means either (a) reproduce Fernet in WebCrypto/`@noble`, or (b) pick a TS-native equivalent below. Crypto.io's Fernet docs note Fernet is "ideal for [...] encrypting data that easily fits in memory" — i.e. encrypt the *id mapping*, not the PDF bytes — https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/

### Branca — XChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD token (TS-native, but stale lib)
- Wire format: `Version (0xBA, 1B) ‖ Timestamp (32-bit unsigned big-endian) ‖ Nonce (24B) ‖ Ciphertext (*) ‖ Poly1305 Tag (16B)`, base62-encoded (`0-9A-Za-z`). AEAD = IETF XChaCha20-Poly1305, 32-byte (256-bit) key. Header is authenticated but not encrypted (timestamp readable, tamper-proof) — https://github.com/tuupola/branca-spec/blob/master/README.md
- Like Fernet, **expiry is not embedded**: decoders optionally take a `ttl` added to the token timestamp and compared to now, checked *after* AEAD verification. 32-bit timestamp overflows in 2106 (not 2038) — https://github.com/tuupola/branca-spec/blob/master/README.md
- **Maintenance gotcha:** the canonical JS lib `branca` is at **0.5.0, last published 2022-04-27 (MIT)** — ~4 years stale (verified via npm registry `registry.npmjs.org/branca`). Types are a separate `@types/branca@0.4.2` (2023). Treat the *spec* as portable but do not adopt the unmaintained package; re-implement on `@noble/ciphers` instead (below).

### PASETO v4.local — XChaCha20 + BLAKE2b (spec strong, JS lib stale)
- `v4.local` uses XChaCha20 for encryption with a keyed-BLAKE2b authentication tag (vs Branca's Poly1305). PASETO's selling point is "no algorithm confusion / no unsafe options; every version is a fixed cipher suite" — https://github.com/paseto-standard/paseto-spec/blob/master/docs/Rationale-V3-V4.md and https://www.scottbrady.io/jose/alternatives-to-jwts
- Caveats for this use case: limited ecosystem, not OAuth/OIDC compatible, manual revocation. The panva `paseto` npm is at **3.1.4, 2023-04-27** (stale; verified via npm registry) — same "good spec, sleepy JS lib" problem as Branca. Comparative landscape: https://securityboulevard.com/2025/11/jwt-vs-paseto-vs-branca-the-future-of-secure-tokens-in-2026/

### iron-webcrypto — the maintained, WebCrypto-native sealed-token (strong candidate)
- Seals a JSON object with symmetric encryption + integrity into a compact URL-safe string `Fe26.2**...`; default cipher **AES-256-CBC + HMAC-SHA256** (not AEAD; authors note "future releases may explore" AEAD). Runs anywhere `crypto.subtle` exists: **Node 20+, Deno, Bun, Cloudflare Workers** — https://github.com/brc-dd/iron-webcrypto/blob/main/README.md
- Has a **first-class `ttl` option** (ms) plus a 60s default clock skew, and a password-`id` mechanism for key rotation (embed id in token, look up the matching password on unseal) — https://github.com/brc-dd/iron-webcrypto/blob/main/README.md
- **Security gotcha to verify in a port:** default PBKDF2 iterations = **1** (README acknowledges "suboptimal," mitigated by requiring a high-entropy 32+ byte password rather than a human password). For our use case the "password" is a server-held random key, so iter=1 is acceptable — but it means *do not* feed it a low-entropy secret — https://github.com/brc-dd/iron-webcrypto/blob/main/README.md
- **Maintenance:** `iron-webcrypto@2.0.0` last published **2025-11-25 (MIT)** — actively maintained (verified via npm registry). It is the WebCrypto reimplementation of `@hapi/iron` and is the crypto core behind `iron-session` (Next.js), so it is battle-tested for "sealed cookie/token" workloads — https://github.com/brc-dd/iron-webcrypto and https://www.npmjs.com/package/iron-webcrypto

### JWE (encrypted JWT) via `jose` — heavier, standards-track
- For an encrypted (not just signed) token, `jose` supports JWE (RFC 7516): `dir` key management + `A256GCM` content encryption gives an AEAD sealed token with `exp` claim handled by the JWT layer. `jose@6.2.3` last published **2026-04-27 (MIT)** — actively maintained (verified via npm registry). Landscape: https://www.scottbrady.io/jose/alternatives-to-jwts
- Tradeoff: JWE is verbose (5-part compact serialization, JSON headers) and OAuth-shaped; overkill for an opaque local download link where the URL must be *short and non-revealing*. JWT/JWE also leak structure in the header even when the payload is encrypted — https://zitadel.com/blog/jwt-vs-opaque-tokens

### HMAC-signed URL — signed (not encrypted), stateless expiry
- The "signed URL" family (AWS SigV4 presigned, GCS signed URLs, NGINX `secure_link`) binds expiry+path+scope into an `HMAC-SHA256` over a canonical string; the signature makes the `expires` epoch tamper-evident so a client cannot extend its own access — https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signed-urls and https://blog.cyril.email/posts/2025-03-12/url-protection-through-hmac.html
- Best-practice TTLs are **short** (AWS prescriptive guidance / GCS default ~15 min; sign just-before-use, not ahead of time) — which conflicts with our "default 7 days" requirement. A long-lived signed URL is hard to revoke (see revocation tradeoff). HMAC also means every signer holds the same secret (key-distribution blast radius); asymmetric signing isolates the private key — https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/prescriptive-guidance/latest/presigned-url-best-practices/presigned-url-best-practices.pdf and https://blog.cyril.email/posts/2025-03-12/url-protection-through-hmac.html
- Note the signed-URL approach does **not** encrypt the embedded path/ids — so it fails the "non-business-revealing" requirement unless the path is itself an opaque id. Encryption (Fernet/Branca/iron) is needed when the *payload* must be hidden, not just tamper-proof.

### `@noble/ciphers` — the repo-native way to build a Fernet/Branca analog
- `@noble/ciphers@2.2.0` (published **2026-04-11, MIT, 0 dependencies**, audited, PGP-signed) exports `xchacha20poly1305` directly (`import { xchacha20poly1305 } from '@noble/ciphers/chacha.js'`) — the exact Branca/PASETO-v4 primitive — https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-ciphers/blob/main/README.md and https://www.npmjs.com/package/@noble/ciphers
- **Repo already depends on `@noble/hashes@^2.2.0`** (HMAC-SHA256/BLAKE2b) and `uuid@^14.0.1` (verified in repo `package.json` catalog). Adding `@noble/ciphers` gives a zero-dep, audited path to a small in-house "sealed link" token (XChaCha20-Poly1305 over `{appNo, docId, exp}`), avoiding the stale `branca`/`paseto` packages while keeping the Effect-first surface. WebCrypto `AES-256-GCM` (built into `crypto.subtle`) is an even-lighter alternative if a native AEAD is preferred over a noble dependency.

### UUIDv4 opaque-id vs signed-token — the core tradeoff
- A v4 UUID has **122 bits of randomness** (6 of 128 bits fixed for version/variant) — https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9562.html . The repo's `uuid@14` generates v4 via `crypto.getRandomValues` (CSPRNG), so it is unguessable enough for a capability id — but note the general caution that "UUIDs were designed for uniqueness, not secrecy" and some environments don't guarantee a CSPRNG; for a pure secret prefer a dedicated 128–256-bit token — https://fastuuid.com/learn-about-uuids/uuid-security/
- **Opaque/reference token (UUID + store row):** compact, reveals nothing, and gives **immediate revocation** (delete/flag the row) — but requires a **stateful lookup on every request** — https://nordicapis.com/jwt-vs-opaque-tokens-choosing-the-right-token-for-api-security/
- **Stateless signed/sealed token (HMAC/Branca/iron/JWE):** self-contained, expiry embedded & tamper-proof, **no DB lookup** — but **cannot be revoked before expiry without a blocklist** (which reintroduces the very state you were avoiding) — https://nordicapis.com/jwt-vs-opaque-tokens-choosing-the-right-token-for-api-security/
- **Recommended shape for this wedge (hybrid):** opaque UUIDv4 in the URL (revocable, non-revealing) **backed by** an encrypted store row that holds the real app/document ids + `expires_at`. This matches both porting sources (UUID at the edge + Fernet-encrypted mapping in SQLite) and gives default-7d TTL *and* instant revocation. Use a stateless sealed token only if you must avoid a store entirely.

### Capability-URL hygiene (W3C TAG) — non-business-revealing requirement
- W3C TAG "Good Practices for Capability URLs": make the id unguessable via a secure RNG; if hashing, use HMAC (not vulnerable to length-extension); **do not put personal/business data in the URL** (the document's motivating failure is private file URLs leaking confidential data to third parties) — https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/capability-urls/
- Mitigate Referer leakage: putting the secret in the URL *fragment* avoids the `Referer` header (though embedded third-party scripts can still read the fragment); pair with a strict `Referrer-Policy` — https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/capability-urls/ and https://web.dev/articles/referrer-best-practices . For a local-first Tauri sidecar serving `localhost`, cross-origin Referer leak is low-risk, but `cache-control: private, no-store` (already in the porting source) is the relevant control.

### Backing link store — SQLite vs PGlite (repo-native)
- Python original uses SQLite. Repo-native equivalent: **`@electric-sql/pglite@0.5.3`** is already a dependency (verified in repo `package.json`), with `@effect/sql` adapters present at `packages/drivers/pglite` and `packages/drivers/postgres`, `drizzle-orm@1.0.0-rc.4` in the catalog, and an `EntityId`/`EntityTable` pattern at `packages/drivers/drizzle/src/EntityTable.models.ts` + `packages/foundation/modeling/identity`. So the link store can be a normal Effect `@effect/sql` table (cols ≈ `id uuid pk, enc_payload bytea/blob, created_at, expires_at, revoked_at nullable`) rather than a bespoke SQLite file.
- Default 7-day TTL = `expires_at = now + 7d`; expiry enforced both by store query (`WHERE expires_at > now() AND revoked_at IS NULL`) **and** by the edge guard 404ing on missing/expired; revocation = set `revoked_at`/delete row (immediate, the opaque-token advantage above). IDB/Dexie is only relevant if the link store must live in the *renderer*, which contradicts "key/server-side" — keep the store in the sidecar process.

### Key custody — where the key lives so it never reaches desktop/LLM
- Threat model from the porting source: the LLM/agent receives **only the opaque URL**; the encryption key + real business ids live server-side. Effect's `Redacted` is the in-process guard — `Redacted.make` hides the value, `console.log`/`Effect.log` print `<redacted>`, `Redacted.value` is the explicit unwrap, `Redacted.unsafeWipe` clears memory — so the key never lands in logs/traces — https://effect.website/docs/data-types/redacted/ . `Redacted` is already used across the repo (e.g. `packages/drivers/sanity`, `packages/tooling/...`).
- **Windows DPAPI** (the porting source's optional key protection): `ProtectedData.Protect`/`CryptProtectData` with `DataProtectionScope.CurrentUser` ties the key to the logged-in user; master keys live under `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Protect\{SID}`. "Appropriate for data never read outside the current machine" — exactly the at-rest key wrapping we want — https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.protecteddata and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_API
- **DPAPI is Windows-only** — the cross-platform analog for a Tauri desktop is the OS keyring: `tauri-plugin-keyring` (→ `keyring-core`) maps to macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service (GNOME Keyring / KWallet via D-Bus), Windows Credential Manager — https://github.com/charlesportwoodii/tauri-plugin-keyring . **Tauri Stronghold is being deprecated/removed in v3 — do not adopt it**; prefer the OS keyring — https://v2.tauri.app/plugin/stronghold/ and https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/discussions/7846
- Net pattern: random 32-byte master key generated on first run → stored in OS keyring (DPAPI on Win) → loaded into a `Redacted` at sidecar boot → used to seal/unseal the link-store payloads (XChaCha20-Poly1305 / iron / AES-GCM). The renderer (and any LLM tool call) only ever sees `https://localhost.../resources/<uuid>.pdf`.

## Open / Unverified
- **iron-webcrypto AES-256-CBC payload size:** for our use (encrypting a tiny `{appNo, docId, exp}` JSON) CBC vs an AEAD is immaterial, but I did not benchmark token-length/perf for either iron, a noble-built Branca analog, or AES-GCM. UNVERIFIED which produces the shortest URL-safe string.
- **`@types/branca` / `branca` API surface details** (exact `new Branca(key).encode/decode(ttl)` signatures) were not opened beyond the README — moot if we re-implement on `@noble/ciphers`, but UNVERIFIED if the team wants to vendor the package.
- **Exact repo desktop runtime:** the porting source assumes a Tauri sidecar; I confirmed `@electric-sql/pglite`, `drizzle-orm`, `@noble/hashes`, `uuid`, `Redacted` are repo deps, but did **not** confirm `apps/professional-desktop` is Tauri-based vs Electron/Next — the OS-keyring recommendation assumes Tauri. UNVERIFIED.
- **uuid@14 CSPRNG guarantee in the sidecar runtime:** uuid v4 uses `crypto.getRandomValues` in Node/browser; if the link id is generated in an exotic runtime (e.g. a stripped Bun/embedded env) confirm a CSPRNG is present, or mint the id from `crypto.randomUUID()` / a 32-byte `getRandomValues` instead. UNVERIFIED for the exact target runtime.
- **DPAPI from a Node/TS sidecar:** DPAPI is a .NET/Win32 API; calling `CryptProtectData` from the Node/Tauri-Rust sidecar needs an FFI/native binding (or the Rust `windows` crate). I did not verify a maintained Node binding — on Windows the `tauri-plugin-keyring` (Credential Manager) path is the cleaner route. UNVERIFIED whether a direct-DPAPI Node binding is warranted vs the keyring abstraction.
