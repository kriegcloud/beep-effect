# Multi-Provider LLM Dispatch + Graceful Fallback

## Status

Stage: `research`
Status: `active`

Source: [`ops/manifest.json`](./ops/manifest.json)

## Spark

beep already ships the four per-provider LLM drivers (`@beep/anthropic`,
`@beep/openai-compat`, `@beep/xai`, `@beep/venice-ai`) but nothing owns the
layer above them: a shared Effect dispatch Layer that resolves keys by
user-key > env > CLI precedence, falls back across providers with
`Layer.orElse` + retry, and resolves each provider's OWN default model so a
fallback never inherits an incompatible model name.

## Next Open Question

**Q1 (highest-leverage):** Does this packet own only the declarative
dispatch/registry surface ABOVE `ExecutionPlan`, or also the shared retry/
`Schedule` policy library plus round-robin + circuit-breaker? This root scope
fork gates the whole packet — including its sequencing dependency on sibling
`effect-orchestration-patterns` (Q1), build-vs-buy (Q2), and V1 resilience scope
(Q7). Recommended answer pre-drafted in [`DECISIONS.md`](./DECISIONS.md); resolve
the full set with `/grill-with-docs multi-provider-llm-dispatch-fallback`.

## Sources & provenance

[`research/SOURCES.md`](./research/SOURCES.md) — the provenance ledger tracing
this packet's 8 gold nuggets to their upstream repos + licenses, the on-disk
external citations, and the `@beep/*` capabilities they compose. Derived from the
gold-intake cluster "Multi-provider LLM dispatch + graceful fallback"
