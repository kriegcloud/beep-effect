# Specifications

This directory contains specifications for all major features and enhancements in the beep-effect codebase, following a structured spec-driven development approach that ensures systematic planning, implementation, and validation.

## Structure

Each feature specification follows a standardized structure within its own directory:

- **`instructions.md`** - Initial requirements capture and user story
- **`requirements.md`** - Detailed functional and non-functional requirements
- **`design.md`** - Technical design and architectural decisions
- **`plan.md`** - Implementation roadmap with progress tracking

## Workflow

The specification-driven development process follows three key phases:

### 1. Specification Phase

Document requirements, design architecture, and create detailed implementation plans before beginning development work.

### 2. Implementation Phase

Execute the planned implementation following beepe-effect library patterns and quality standards, with continuous validation against specifications.

### 3. Validation Phase

Verify that the final implementation meets all specified requirements and maintains beep-effect standards for type safety, functional programming patterns, and comprehensive documentation.

---

Each feature specification ensures:

- **Systematic Development**: Structured approach from conception to completion
- **beep-effect repository Compliance**: Adherence to functional programming patterns and type safety standards
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive validation including JSDoc compilation, testing, and documentation
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear visibility into implementation status and completion criteria
