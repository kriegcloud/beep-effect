# Plan: Frontend Websocket Enablement Research

## Phase 1: Research & Context Analysis [checkpoint: complete]
- [x] Task: specific research on existing streaming services implemented with Effect Layer and IndexedDB.
- [x] Task: Evaluate current identity and encryption mechanisms and how they apply to live websocket events.

## Phase 2: Strategy & Documentation [checkpoint: complete]
- [x] Task: Create a comprehensive review/design document for implementing and connecting the websocket backend layer to the frontend. (See: `docs/architecture/frontend_websocket_research.md`)
- [x] Task: Code Review of Data Flow End-to-End. (See: `docs/architecture/frontend_data_flow_review.md`)
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Strategy & Documentation' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: UX & Architecture Strategy [checkpoint: complete]
- [x] Task: Evaluate and plan architectural and frontend designs for streamlined event flow. (See: `docs/architecture/frontend_ux_strategy.md`)
- [x] Task: Evaluate and plan core workflow streamlining (Links -> Documents -> Timeline). (See: `docs/architecture/workflow_streamlining_plan.md`)
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'UX & Architecture Strategy' (Protocol in workflow.md)
