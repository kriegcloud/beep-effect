## Quick Install

Add any component directly to your project using the CLI:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.heygaia.io/r/raised-button.json
```

That's it! The component is now in your project, ready to use.

## Prerequisites

GAIA UI works with any React project that has:

- **Tailwind CSS** configured
- **Path aliases** set up (typically `@/*` pointing to your project root)

Most modern setups already have these. If you're using Next.js, Vite with React, or any Tailwind-based starter, you're good to go.

### Utility Function

Components use a `cn()` helper for class merging. If you don't have one yet, create `lib/utils.ts`:

```ts
import { clsx, type ClassValue } from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install clsx tailwind-merge
```

### Icons (Optional)

Some components use [Hugeicons](https://hugeicons.com). Install if needed:

```bash
npm install @hugeicons/react @hugeicons/core-free-icons
```

## Adding Components

### Via CLI (Recommended)

Every component has a one-line install command. Find the component you want in our [library](/docs/components/raised-button), then run:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.heygaia.io/r/[component-name].json
```

The CLI automatically:
- Installs required dependencies
- Installs any GAIA UI components it depends on
- Places the component in your `components/ui` folder

### Manual Copy

Prefer to copy-paste? Each component page has a "Code" tab. Copy the code and save it to your project.

## Using Components

Import from your components folder:

```tsx
import { RaisedButton } from "@/components/ui/raised-button";

export default function Page() {
  return <RaisedButton>Get Started</RaisedButton>;
}
```
