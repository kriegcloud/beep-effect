Context Engineering

- One agent you are chatting with who can deploy other agents to fetch context. They can have multiple running in parallel
- You could ask chat to just pull in all your tasks
- You can configure the AI to have memory. We need to give it the context.
    - Can it go through my email and build out contacts
    - Can it go into Salesforce and pull from there
- I can tag a client and then ask about that
- It can then know my client list if I have a broader question
- Ability to make agent to do repetitive tasks
    - Categorizing Emails
    - Proof reading
    - Creating outstanding task lists
    - This is important because as you go on it will have more and more context to work with
    - This will get you quicker and better answers
- Then you have your controlling agent (this would be like the Chat GPT)
- As a company, we need to keep track of context which will be what corresponds to price
- If we were to deploy this tomorrow, no fees, what is the cost to us?
    - Depends on what AI we use. Our built-in API would cost us money
    - I can put in my ChatGPT AI key though and then it would essentially be free. They only get charged through their account.

Resources

- Stuff we put into it - “Domain Knowledge”. This is different than the agents because this will be what I put into it
- Training guides
