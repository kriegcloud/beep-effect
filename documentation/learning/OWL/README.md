# OWL 2 Web Ontology Language
The OWL 2 Web Ontology Language, informally OWL 2, is an ontology language for the Semantic Web with formally defined 
meaning. OWL 2 ontologies provide classes, properties, individuals, and data values and are stored as Semantic 
Web documents. OWL 2 ontologies can be used along with information written in RDF, and OWL 2 ontologies themselves 
are primarily exchanged as RDF documents. The OWL 2 Document Overview describes the overall state of OWL 2, and 
should be read before other OWL 2 documents.
